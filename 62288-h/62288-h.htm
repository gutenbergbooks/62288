<hr class="tiny" />

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE LITTLE EARTHQUAKE GIRL</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS Billy Bennett wheeled around the corner
he saw his mother in the doorway. Also
he saw Jean Hammond across the street speaking
with Bess Carter,&mdash;the Queen of Sheba,
the children called her, she was so large and
dark and handsome, and had such a royal way,
like a sure &#8217;nough queen, one said. Though
why children who had never been out of Vine
County should know so much about queens
no one thought to ask.</p>

<p>Billy suspected his mother was waiting for
him; he must hurry, he thought. Yet he
couldn&#8217;t resist showing off a bit. He bent over
his wheel, went by the girls with a rush and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
&#8220;Hello!&#8221; made a neat turn, wheeled a figure
&#8220;8&#8221; around a team or two, shouted, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
frame up anything there!&#8221; as he passed a second
time, and whizzed through the arch in his own
high hedge with one wheel in the air.</p>

<p>He swung his book-strap in greeting to his
mother while rolling more slowly up the rose-bordered
path to the veranda. He thought his
mother&#8217;s face looked tired; but the smile there
welcomed him warmly, and he forgot the tired
look with her first words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to make you late with your mowing,
Billy, but I must have you go out to Mrs.
Prettyman&#8217;s for some cream she promised me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you need it right away?&#8221; Billy stood
his wheel against the steps and flung his books
on the porch table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not till evening; but there&#8217;s the lawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll mow in the morning. Let me stay and
visit Pretty&mdash;Harold, I mean&mdash;till sundown;
can&#8217;t I, mamma?&#8221; He patted her cheek with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
a vigor that made her wink. &#8220;You know you
can&#8217;t refuse your darling boy,&#8221; he wheedled.</p>

<p>In spite of her smile there was a tinge of
gravity in her silent moment of consideration.
&#8220;Very well, Billy. You know how short Saturday
is, and that to-morrow you&#8217;ll wish you&#8217;d
cut the grass to-day. Yet I leave it to you;
do as you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy gave her a squeeze that made her
last words come in jerks. &#8220;That&#8217;s a mean
trick to play on a fellow,&mdash;chuck such a responsibility
on a twelve-year-old. Say I must
or I mustn&#8217;t, mamma.&#8221; He caught her hand
and gently tweaked her fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not a baby, my son; you&#8217;ll soon be
a man, and it&#8217;s time you did your own thinking.
Don&#8217;t be late for dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy took the can she held toward him, and
made a face that was half fun, half discontent,
yet not unloving. As his mother turned indoors
he noticed again that she was pale, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that her shoulders drooped; and a sudden heat
rose in his heart against the widowhood and
poverty that made it necessary for her to work
so hard. When he grew to be a man, he told
himself, he would buy her a diamond ring and
a silk dress; and she should sit all day in the
big rocking chair and work no more.</p>

<p>To-day his mother&#8217;s words had left a pang.
He would soon be a man and have to &#8220;think
for himself.&#8221; Yes, and work, too. &#8220;Gee whiz!
It&#8217;ll be tough not to play any more,&#8221; he exclaimed
under his breath as he bowled along
the tree-lined road that led to the Prettyman
farm.</p>

<p>In the hours of joy that followed, joy known
only to boys and farms in conjunction, Billy,&mdash;and
it was unusual for him,&mdash;more than once
recalled his mother&#8217;s words; heeded them to the
extent of bidding Harold a reluctant good-bye
when the sun was still blazing high above the
horizon. But when, on his way home, he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to the branching of the road his good resolution
weakened. He looked back. The sun was surely
more than an hour high. He would have time
to go up the hill road to the &#8220;Ha&#8217;nt.&#8221; And,
beside that, he wished to look at the river where
its divided flow encircled a tiny, shrub-grown
island.</p>

<p>A certain wide lawn, starred with white
clover and daisies came unwelcome to his
mind. He ought that moment to be chopping
off clover tops.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jiminy! I&#8217;ll have time in the morning,&#8221;
he said aloud, and hurried on, not slackening
his speed till he came to a sharp turn that took
the road against the face of a rugged mountain.
He hid his wheel and can in a tangle of rose
vine and snowdrop, and stood out on the edge
of the steep bluff that overhung the rushing
river. There bloomed the island. Near the
centre a rocky point was aflame with gorgeous
poppies; and Billy could smell the fragrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of the snowy wild heliotrope,&mdash;pop-corn the
children called it.</p>

<p>The water would soon be low enough, he decided,
though the end of the suspension foot-bridge
hung very near surface. The rains had
come in a sudden flood that year, delaying
sport he had planned, in which the island was
to play an important part.</p>

<p>He went on, a little cautiously now, and
shortly came in view of the &#8220;Ha&#8217;nt,&#8221; a
sinister though imposing house, built of cut
stone, close against the face of the most picturesque
mountain of the range, bounding Vina
Valley. The windows were curtained with
cobwebs and dust. For years the wide front
door had been nailed up with the same sun-bleached
boards; and &#8220;Keep out!&#8221; spoke from
every gray splinter.</p>

<p>Billy knew by sight the two Italians who
lived there, brothers yet enemies. Each dwelt
by himself in a corner of the great building.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Each cultivated alone his share of the straggling
vineyard on the heights above, too steep and
rocky for a plough; though the lush acres on
the river bottom went fallow. If either overstepped
his bounds they fought. Billy had
seen one of these encounters; and the fierce
fire in their dark faces, the passion in the foreign
words they spoke,&mdash;oaths the boy felt
they must be,&mdash;sent him flying home, tinged
his dreams for many a night.</p>

<p>He was not more inquisitive than other boys,
yet the mystery, the many uncanny tales told
of the old house, fired him with a desire to know
its secrets. Long before he was born a murder
had left its stain there. The owners, suspected
but unconvicted, moved away; and for years
the house stared vacantly at passers. The
coming of the Italians had only increased its
bad name. Late travellers on the lonely road
declared that shadowy forms and flickering
lights passed the lower windows and down into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the cavernous basement; yet no sounds ever
came from behind the barred doors.</p>

<p>Rational people laughed at these stories,
declared them the fancies of brains fuddled by
too long a stay at the saloons in town. But
Billy was not so easily satisfied. He wished
to see for himself those shadowy forms; to
prove to the small, scared children that, contrary
to general belief, the brothers sometimes
had guests. And he had a queer feeling that
some way the house would have a place in his
life. He admired its gloomy grandeur; planned
the additions he would make if it were his
own, and the gardens, the hedges of roses, and
banks of fragrant smilax, that should grow
there.</p>

<p>Now he crept through the brush by the roadside
till he came close under the west wall.
The setting sun blazed red fire at him from the
windows, reminding him sharply of the hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Golly! Wish&#8217;t I had time to stay an&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
watch. But I won&#8217;t, Betsey; I&#8217;ll go right
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy at work or at play was so absorbed that
it was hard for him to measure time; and he
had a queer notion that it was some other intelligence
beside his own will that reminded
him, often too late, of duties waiting. This
he named Betsey; and among the children
Betsey came to stand for Billy&#8217;s conscience.</p>

<p>Up on the hillside one of the brothers still
plied the hoe; and now the other came from
the back door and walked down the road with
his milk can in his hand. Billy had &#8220;the
creeps&#8221; for a minute, and cowered closer; but
no one saw him. Now was the time! He
would never have such a chance again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You keep still, Betsey! I&#8217;m going to
watch!&#8221; he exclaimed, as if some one had
spoken.</p>

<p>Cautiously he crept nearer the door, stopping
at each step to listen, to look again at the worker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
above. He was at the very corner of the house
when voices sounded from within. He started,
his breath coming quicker. He caught no
words, but knew by the &#8220;ginger&#8221; in the tones
that the speakers were angry. Shuffling steps
came up the stairway and turned toward the
rear.</p>

<p>The boy scudded lightly across the narrow
open space to the shelter of a manzanita tree,
and looked back again; but no one appeared.
Did he still hear the softly quarrelling voices?
He fancied so. The sudden dip of the sun
behind a hill darkened the scene threateningly,
and brought a return of &#8220;the creeps.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not the hour for ghosts, they must be
real people. Billy encouraged himself with
that thought and wished he could wait for
further disclosures. Did the sun ever before
go down so fast? He hastened to find his
wheel and can, and set out at his best pace.</p>

<p>As he came into the main road a rosy, wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
looking girl was flying by. &#8220;Hello, Jean!&#8221;
he called after her; &#8220;that&#8217;s going some&mdash;for a
girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned back and rode up by his side.
&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t a girl ride as fast as a boy?&#8221;
She had a bright, frank face, and her brown
eyes were as honest as they were beautiful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I s&#8217;pose she can, only a fellow doesn&#8217;t
expect it of her. How came you out here?
I thought you&#8217;d be watching for refugees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hurrying for. Mamma
sent me on an errand to Mrs. Black&#8217;s and I
want to be back at the station in time to see
the train come in. I wish we were going to
have a refugee. Wasn&#8217;t the earthquake awful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And the fire worse. Why can&#8217;t you
have a refugee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our house isn&#8217;t big enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess ours&#8217;ll be a grown-up chap; but I
wish he&#8217;d be a boy my size. How do you guess
poor old San Francisco looks to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, Billy, don&#8217;t ask me. I can&#8217;t bear to
think of it. But I almost forgot,&mdash;your mother
said if I saw you to tell you to go by the store
and get a loaf of bread. There&#8217;s the train!&#8221;</p>

<p>The whistle shrilled up the narrow valley,
echoing back and forth from the steep green
hills that bounded it.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s at Vine Hill&mdash;miles away; we&#8217;ll beat
her if we hurry.&#8221; His words were a bit breathless.</p>

<p>Off they bounded, side by side, through the
fragrant spring evening. The red of the western
sky touched to brighter rosiness their glowing
cheeks, tinted Jean&#8217;s wind-blown hair with gold.
As they neared the town she shot ahead in a last
ambitious spurt, wheeled and faced him as he
came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything else you can do better than a
girl?&#8221; she jeered, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try a mile with this can and see where you
come out in the race.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>&#8220;Why have you been away out in the country
for milk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This milk happens to be cream. I&#8217;ve been
wondering what kind of a dessert will take all
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean hid a queer little smile that she could
not repress.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wrestle with you first chance,&#8221; he challenged;
&#8220;but you wouldn&#8217;t have any show, your
dress is so long. Why do you have &#8217;em so?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean&#8217;s face fell, and she didn&#8217;t look at Billy
when she spoke. &#8220;My mother says I mustn&#8217;t
wrestle any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I wonder? She used to watch us at
it and laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but&mdash;oh, Billy, it&#8217;s awful to have
to grow up and be proper. I begged mamma
not to put my dresses down, but I&#8217;m past
thirteen, and big as she is. And&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no giant. She isn&#8217;t bigger&#8217;n a kid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Will she let you come to play? The Gang&#8217;s
coming to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can come. Shall I bring Clarence,
too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. All the kids. But Clarence especially,&mdash;he&#8217;s
my son, you know.&#8221; Billy
grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;And just worships you. Is your lawn
mowed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;ll do it first thing to-morrow.&#8221;
He tried vainly to change the subject. &#8220;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Billy To-morrow! You won&#8217;t have
half time enough to play. You&#8217;re a regular
Mexican,&mdash;always <i>mañana</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the train snorted into the station the
two were there, Billy with his loaf under his
arm, his can dangling. Most of the arrivals
were townsfolk home from visits to the stricken
city; but a few, evidently strangers, descended
and stood by themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;That bunch with the tickets, them&#8217;s the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
refugees,&#8221; Billy whispered to Jean. &#8220;See?
Mr. Patton&#8217;s talking to them. Mr. Brown&#8217;s
going to take &#8217;em to their places in his hack.
I wonder which is ours. Jiminy! See how
hard that poor little kid&#8217;s trying to bluff her
tears!&#8221;</p>

<p>He indicated a fair-haired child, a baby in
size, though her face gave hint of more years
than her slender body. She wore woman&#8217;s
shoes, and one was torn; a draggled skirt
pinned up in front and trailing behind; and a
folded sheet drawn around her shoulders. Yet
no incongruity of dress could disguise the refined
beauty of her face, or of her uncovered
hair.</p>

<p>A kindly man held her by the hand, yet he
was evidently a stranger to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, ask Mr. Patton to let her come to
your house! There aren&#8217;t any boys.&#8221; Jean&#8217;s
voice trembled with eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! Take care of the truck, will you?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
He dropped his burdens to Jean&#8217;s willing hands,
and darted forward.</p>

<p>Mr. Patton, who &#8220;placed&#8221; the refugees, was
glad of Billy&#8217;s request, for the child&#8217;s struggle
for self-control had touched him; and he knew
no one would be a kinder mother to her than
Mrs. Bennett.</p>

<p>Billy hurried away, and arrived at his home
before the hack, bread and cream safe in spite
of threatened dangers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ma! Mamma Bennett,&#8221; he burst out as
he banged open the door; &#8220;she&#8217;s coming,&mdash;our
little earthquake girl! The cutest kid,&mdash;not
so big as the twins, but stylisher in the
face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett was setting the table. She put
down a pile of plates, and a new anxiety came
into her careworn face. &#8220;A child? I told
Mr. Patton I couldn&#8217;t take one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I asked for her, mamma.&#8221; Billy&#8217;s
voice lost its exuberance. His mother never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
had looked so tired, he thought for the second
time that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Billy, how could you, when mother has
so much to do?&#8221; It was his sister, Edith, who
spoke, her sweet face clouded with rare disapproval.
Yet she went on with the music
lesson she was giving.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help a lot. You shan&#8217;t have a bit
more trouble, sister; nor mamma, either.&#8221;
He began to distribute the plates with noisy
clatter.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be afraid to sleep in the downstairs
bedroom,&#8221; Mrs. Bennett reflected, planning
rapidly for the unexpected child whom she
still had no thought of turning from her door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put her in my room and give me the Fo&#8217;castle;
I&#8217;ve always wanted to bunk there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She may come with me, mother,&#8221; Edith
said, pausing in the lesson with finger uplifted
on the beat; &#8220;Billy mustn&#8217;t go into that bleak
tank house.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Mrs. Bennett crossed the room and laid a tender
hand on her daughter&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;You&#8217;re
not strong and need perfect rest. Besides, you
spoil the boy. It won&#8217;t hurt him to sleep there,
and he must take the consequences of his own
act.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet let him sleep downstairs,&#8221; Edith persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, the Fo&#8217;castle! I&mdash;Here they
come!&#8221; Billy set down some cups with dangerous
haste and ran out.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p0018-illus.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">The little earthquake girl</p>

<p>In spite of noise and heedlessness there was
something fine and true about Billy; something
that made old Bouncer whine when left behind;
something that called the kittens to rub against
his legs; that made the little children at school
adore him, and men and women smile heartily
when they greeted him. It was this mysterious
something that brought a wan smile to the
small tired face and tired eyes that looked confidingly
into his blue ones. He lifted her carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
down from the carriage, and led her up
the walk to where his mother and sister came
to meet them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Your nose is out of joint, Edith! I&#8217;ve got
a new sister.&#8221; But his eyes belied his blunt
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you shall be our dear little girl.&#8221;
Mrs. Bennett took the forlorn child in her
motherly arms and kissed her. &#8220;You&#8217;re tired
and hungry, too, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you. But most my heart is
hungry. Will you help me to find my mama?&#8221;</p>

<p>The quaint words seemed incongruous for so
small a child, as did her self-control; and the
accent on the last syllable of &#8220;mama&#8221; made her
seem almost foreign to Billy. Yet he admired
her anew as she tried to hold still her trembling
lips, to restrain her tears; as she threw up her
head, winked hard, and felt vainly for a handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you poor darling, take mine! And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
don&#8217;t be afraid&mdash;you&#8217;ll find your mother
before long.&#8221; Edith&#8217;s words were brave, but
her own eyes were moist.</p>

<p>&#8220;First you must eat, and rest, so that you can
tell us about your mother; then we&#8217;ll see what
can be done.&#8221; Mrs. Bennett took the child
into the pleasant living-room where Billy had
put a fourth place at the table next his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, little kid, what&#8217;s your name?&#8221; he
asked, merrily, as he routed a great white cat
from his own chair and placed it before the
fire for the child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary Ellen Smith; but my mama calls me
May Nell; and she says&mdash;she says &#8216;kid&#8217; is
vulgar.&#8221; The last words were very shy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The child may eclipse you in refining Billy&#8217;s
language,&#8221; Mrs. Bennett said, with a smile,
aside to Edith; and went into the kitchen to
&#8220;dish up&#8221; the dinner.</p>

<p>Edith finished her music lesson, dismissed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
her pupil, and made the little girl tidy if comical,
in one of her own frocks. And when the
four sat to eat, Billy&#8217;s voice rang above the
rest in the little song they sang in lieu of grace.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE SATURDAY GANG</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE place Billy called the Fo&#8217;castle was a
tiny room in the sloping windmill tower.
It was level with the second floor of the house,
and a narrow, railed bridge connected it with a
door in his mother&#8217;s room. Under it was the
above-ground cellar, overhead the big tank. Still
higher whirled the great white wings that
pumped the beauty-giving water to lawn and
gardens.</p>

<p>The little room was rude and bare, but Billy
loved it. He thought the massive beams like
the ribs of a ship, and planned to hang between
them all his ship pictures. Anything relating
to the sea fired his imagination. It gave him
a sense of manliness to sleep there alone; and
when the heavier gusts of night wind rocked
the tower, and each revolution of the big wheel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
splashed the water against the tank, as waves
lap a ship&#8217;s side, he dreamed himself on the
ocean, called himself &#8220;Captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>He woke early the next morning. This was
rare for him; he usually slept like a bear in
midwinter. Perhaps the creaking of the windmill
all through the night made his slumber
light. Another noise had disturbed him, the
sewing machine. Its whirr had come up to
him from the open window of the living-room.
He knew mother and sister were sewing hard,
that on the morrow the poor little stranger
might be suitably clad. <i>He</i> had brought upon
them this extra work! And this was only the
beginning. If the child&#8217;s mother was not
found they must buy clothes as well as food;
and this would take a lot of his sister&#8217;s money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jiminy! If they don&#8217;t let me work this
vacation, I&#8217;ll have to run away,&#8221; he thought
as, through the uncurtained window, he watched
the evening star sink below the western hills.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
While he was wondering if people lived in the
star he fell asleep; yet waked later to hear the
busy machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Golly! They&#8217;re working all night. I&mdash;ought
to&mdash;help&mdash;to-morrow. I&mdash;&#8221; He slept
again with his good resolution half made.</p>

<p>Yet the impression of the night had been
deep enough to wake him before the sun rose.
He dressed quickly, astonished the chickens
with an early breakfast; put fresh sand in the
coop; climbed the windmill tower to oil the
bearings of the big wheel; and put the lawn
mower in order, but remembered in time that
to use it would wake the sleepers.</p>

<p>What more might he do to hasten the Saturday
work? He could not chop the kindling
or fill the wood boxes. The weeding! It was
behind. Both mother and sister had reminded
him repeatedly, but he had forgotten. Only
yesterday his sister had made tidy the flower
beds that flanked the house; but the melons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the vegetables,&mdash;they were not done, and that
would make no noise.</p>

<p>The Bennetts&#8217; was one of the oldest places in
town, and the most beautiful. It was near the
heart of the growing village ambitiously calling
itself a city. Level lawns protected by high
hedges and shaded by many trees, spread amply
around the house and back to the first terrace,
where a tangle of berry vines covered trellises
that shut off a lower level devoted to vegetables.
Beyond this was the chickens&#8217; domain, rock-dotted
acres that sloped sharply to where
Runa Creek boiled over its stony bed. Here
mother hens fluttered and scolded while web-footed
broods paddled in the edges of the stream.</p>

<p>Once Billy&#8217;s attention was fixed he was as
earnest at work as at play. He slaughtered
the weeds rapidly, and had several clean beds
behind him when his mother called him to
breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened to you, Billy?&#8221; she asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
when he entered the kitchen. &#8220;For a second
I was frightened when I went to wake you and
found you gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought I&#8217;d eloped? I ought to when
I&#8217;ve brought you an extra mouth to feed.&#8221;
He was splashing and spluttering in the lavatory
off the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, son; we expected to take some
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but some one who could take care of
himself. And you didn&#8217;t expect to open
dressmaking parlors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter, Billy. I think she was sent to
us; and we shall find a way. Are the chickens
fed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, long ago. And, mamma, you needn&#8217;t
ask me that every morning; I&#8217;m going to
remember. Truly!&#8221; he added, as he came
toward her, rosy and shining, and saw her
doubtful smile. &#8220;The vegetables are most
weeded, too.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>Mrs. Bennett put down the pan of batter-cake
dough and gave him his good-morning
kiss. His head was level with hers. &#8220;Thank
you, my big boy. Mother will soon have a man
to look to. Go in and get your breakfast; you
must be nearly famished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I could eat a graven image.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope my breakfast won&#8217;t be quite so&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rocky?&#8221; he interrupted. &#8220;You bet not.
It&#8217;ll be just bully, that&#8217;s what!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Billy!&#8221; she said, despairingly; and he
knew in spite of her smile that she disliked his
words. &#8220;The little girl is looking for you.
She is lonely; you must amuse her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy was suddenly overcome with bashfulness
when the child, quite composed, came
forward to meet him. A bath, a shampoo, and
new clothes had transformed her from a tangled,
smudged little girl to a lovely miss with a
high-bred air foreign to the childish manners
Billy understood. He recognized Edith&#8217;s gown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in the pretty frock mother and daughter had
sat late to make over; but the neat ties and
hose, all the little things it takes to make a girl
look pretty, where had they come from?</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to say &#8216;Good-morning&#8217;
to me, Billy?&#8221; She put out the slenderest
little white hand, and looked into his face
appealingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am,&#8221; he replied promptly, with
a squeeze of her hand that made her wince.
&#8220;At first I was scared; I thought you must be
a fairy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, not a fairy; only Cinderella. Last
night I was the poor little cinder girl; now my
fairy godmothers, two, have touched me with
their wands, needles, and I&#8217;m so fine even the
Prince didn&#8217;t know me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the Prince will see that the glass
slipper&#8217;s tied fast. He&#8217;s got no &#8216;Ho, minions!&#8217;
to hunt for you if you turn Cinderella again.&#8221;
He stooped and fastened her tie.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>She clapped her hands. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad you
like fairies, too. Do you know about Bagdad
and Semiramide and Good King Arthur and
Ivanhoe, and all the other beautiful things in
the world?&#8221; she asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, mother,&#8221; Edith said when Mrs.
Bennett came in with hot cakes, &#8220;what shall
we do with two children in dreamland?&#8221;
Edith had not touched her breakfast, but was
waiting on the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three you should say. Don&#8217;t you live in
the dreamland of music? Eat your own breakfast,
or you&#8217;ll be late for the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Train? Is she going away?&#8221; The small
girl&#8217;s face grew sorrowful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only for a day, dear. I&#8217;ll be back to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has a music class in Loma; and it isn&#8217;t
dreamland, either, teaching; but she has to
earn grub for me, sister does.&#8221; The frank
statement of a truth he had grown accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to this morning roused a feeling of shame, and
he gazed steadily at his plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look so, brother,&#8221; Edith said as she
kissed him good-bye; &#8220;the &#8216;grub&#8217; is making a
fine boy, and I&#8217;m proud of him.&#8221; Yet as she
tied her veil at the mirror she saw the cloud
still lingering on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him play to-day, mother,&#8221; she pleaded,
when the two stepped into the hall; &#8220;he can
be a boy only once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you work hard, and he should do his
part. You are spending your youth for us,
and I&#8217;m glad he begins to see it.&#8221; They spoke
softly, yet Billy knew partly what they said;
and it made him still more thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Edith are fairies,&#8221; he said when
his mother came again to the room, &#8220;to rustle
such pretty togs for the new sister in a night.&#8221;
His mother was piling his plate again with
griddle cakes.</p>

<p>&#8220;My conscience! You can&#8217;t eat all&mdash;&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
May Nell stopped, conscious of an unkindness.
But the boy only laughed; he was used to comments
on his appetite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good hearts need no fairy wings,&#8221; Mrs.
Bennett replied to Billy while she smiled at the
little girl. &#8220;Jean told her mother about our
May Nell, and Mrs. Hammond came over with
a generous lot of outgrown things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Jean&#8217;s two times as big as May Nell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, now. Once she must have been about
the same size, you know.&#8221; She stood behind
the child caressing her cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter with your hand?&#8221; May
Nell asked as she drew the work-worn hand
down and patted it. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t feel like my
mama&#8217;s. And you have only one ring, a plain
one. Are your others in the bank? My mama
has ever so many,&mdash;diamonds, rubies, and such
a big sapphire, perfectly exquisite! And they
look elegant on her hand,&mdash;she has a perfectly
beautiful hand.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>&#8220;There are other things besides gems, little
girl.&#8221; Mrs. Bennett smiled and began to clear
the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her hand would be as pretty as any one&#8217;s if
she didn&#8217;t have to work so hard,&#8221; Billy thought
loyally; and promised himself again that the
first money he earned should buy his mother a
diamond ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take May Nell into the garden with you,
Billy,&#8221; Mrs. Bennett said; &#8220;I shall be busy
with the Saturday work, and she will be happier
in the sunshine. And don&#8217;t speak of the earthquake,&#8221;
she warned him aside; &#8220;she must
forget that as fast as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside the spring warmth and fragrance
enfolded the children as a mantle, opening their
hearts to each other. Billy showed his flock
of pigeons, his white chickens and the house
where they roosted and brought forth their
fluffy broods. Old Bouncer barked and capered
about them; and the little girl tried to decide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which cat was the prettiest, white Flash watching
for gophers in the green alfalfa, or Sir
Thomas Katzenstein, his yellow mate, basking
in the sun. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t yellow like any other
cat I ever saw; he&#8217;s shaded so beautifully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sister says he&#8217;s rare, Persian or something;
but I guess he&#8217;s only a plain cat. He&#8217;s
a lazy thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t your mama have a man to
take care of the grounds?&#8221; she questioned after
she had told him something of her parents
and home.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t, you know; she and sister have to
work hard to make what we spend now. I
don&#8217;t do half enough myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Giving music lessons isn&#8217;t work. I&#8217;d love
to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet it&#8217;s work! &#8217;Specially when she
gets hold of a cub like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You bet&#8217; isn&#8217;t nice,&#8221; the child chid
gently, and waited a moment before continuing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
&#8220;My papa won&#8217;t let my mama work. He went
to South America to get rich. When he comes
back, he wrote in a letter to me, I shall be as
rich as a princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father didn&#8217;t let my mother work when
he was alive; but he&mdash;he died.&#8221; Billy bent
lower over his weeding, and both were quiet.</p>

<p>It was May Nell who first broke the silence.
She had been thinking. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t so very bad
to have to work, is it? Your mama looks happier
than my mama does. She said she&#8217;d
rather wear calico and work ever so hard, and
have papa at home, than be the richest, <i>richest</i>
without him. She cries a lot&mdash;my mama
does. And now&mdash;she&#8217;s crying&mdash;for me.&#8221;
The last word was a sob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, here! You mustn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; Billy
gently coaxed, rising and taking her hand.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll make me draw salt water, too. And
it don&#8217;t help, you know. I&#8217;ll tell you what&mdash;you
can work some, gather the flowers. I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
show you how. Mother puts &#8217;em fresh in all
the rooms for Sunday.&#8221; He bustled her up
the terrace steps, brought scissors and basket,
and, starting her on her pleasant task, began
to mow the lawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;All over the house does she put them?&#8221;
the child asked after she had snipped a fragrant
heap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You see, she rents some of the rooms,
and she says they must look extra nice on Sunday
so the men won&#8217;t mosey off to the saloons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mosey&#8217;? Does that mean &#8216;little Moses&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had hardly recovered from his laugh when
two little girls appeared at the gateway.
&#8220;There&#8217;s Twinnies! Come in, Kiddies, and
see my new sister,&#8221; he called, as they hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;We came&mdash;we came to bring these,&#8221;
one ventured timidly, and lifted one end of the
basket they carried between them.</p>

<p>Billy peeped under the cover, not heeding
the little girls&#8217; protest. &#8220;Golly, May Nell!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
The Queen of Sheba won&#8217;t be in it &#8217;long side of
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett heard anxiety in the voices of
the visitors, and came out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Bennett, you must unpack it alone,
mamma said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone, mamma said,&#8221; came the second
voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett seemed to know exactly what
to do. She took out and displayed to May Nell
some of the generous gift of child&#8217;s wear sent
by Mrs. Dorr from the wardrobe of the twins,
placed the basket within the door, and introduced
the children. Billy wondered what else
might be in the basket that made it &#8220;act so
heavy; it couldn&#8217;t be shoes.&#8221; He looked
critically at May Nell&#8217;s small feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Evelyn Dorr, and Vilette, her sister,&#8221;
Mrs. Bennett was saying.</p>

<p>Billy laughed. &#8220;Mixed again, mamma.
This is Vilette,&#8221; he drew one bashful little girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
nearer the stranger, &#8220;and <i>this</i> is Evelyn, Echo,
we call her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett smiled at her mistake and went
in, while Billy took up his mower. The girls
looked at one another in the mute scrutiny
children bestow on newcomers, May Nell the
least embarrassed of the three.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you as old as us? We&#8217;re seven,&#8221;
Vilette said a bit loftily, as she discovered herself
taller than May Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seven,&#8221; came the echo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last November.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last November,&#8221; piped Evelyn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was ten in January, the twelfth,&#8221; May
Nell replied, with no pride in her tone; she was
always older than those of her size. Yet she
was not prepared for the gasps and backward
movement of the twins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten? You won&#8217;t think of playing with us,
then. Ma thought you&#8217;d be just our age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just our age.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>The little stranger girl smiled winningly. Her
childish companions had not been numerous
enough to justify her in drawing such close
lines; and she liked the sweet, half timid faces
that always looked so earnestly into her own.
&#8220;Surely, I&#8217;ll play with you. I&#8217;ll come to
see you some time when Mrs. Bennett says
I may.&#8221;</p>

<p>A whoop startled her and she turned to see
a handsome boy racing up on a brown pony,
also carrying a basket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Billy To-morrow! Why didn&#8217;t you
do that mowing last night? You said you were
going to.&#8221; He dismounted, tied the pony to
the post, and went inside; and one saw that
in spite of jeers the boys were friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something my mother sent yours. You
mustn&#8217;t touch it,&#8221; he warned, as Billy made a
reach for it. &#8220;I was to land this safe in Mrs.
Bennett&#8217;s hands; and here goes!&#8221; He sprang
from Billy&#8217;s outreached arms, ran into the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and out again, before Billy had time to resume
his mowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, it&#8217;s a donation party, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
Billy did not see Harold wink at the twins, but
picked up his mower and started across the
lawn at a trot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, let me do that,&#8221; Harold commanded;
&#8220;you go and do the rest of your work. We
won&#8217;t get to play in all day. The Gang coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Said so, but they&#8217;re late. We&#8217;ve got an
addition, the little earthquake girl.&#8221; This last
was a sibilant aside.</p>

<p>Harold turned and looked to where May Nell
stood with the twins, sorting her flowers. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
she a daisy, though? Little&mdash;why, she&#8217;s only
a baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out! She&#8217;s ten, an&#8217; never been to
school; but she&#8217;s read more things &#8217;n you &#8217;n
me put together, Pretty. Knows &#8217;em, too.&#8221;
Billy introduced the two in characteristic fashion
and went within.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>&#8220;Mamma, Pretty&#8217;s finishing the lawn for me;
can&#8217;t I rub the floors right now? The Gang&#8217;s
coming and we want to do a lot to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the floors, Billy. You&#8217;ve
worked hard already; run off and have a good
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another time he would have gone quickly
enough, for he liked work as little as the average
boy, often shirked it; though when he forgot
himself in his task, the joy of doing it well
held him to it. But May Nell&#8217;s coming and
the added expense still troubled him; and it
was a resolute face he turned to his mother.
&#8220;No, mamma, you shan&#8217;t get down on your
marrow bones to these old floors. It&#8217;s only me
that needs to go on the knees, you know.&#8221; His
eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>He knew it was he and his friends who were
never denied &#8220;the run of the house,&#8221; that
brought in most of the gray film that settled
so quickly on the dark floors; it was not fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to leave this back-aching task to his mother.
He hustled out the rugs, found dusting cloth,
wax, and rubber, and set vigorously at it,
working so fast that he was nearly finished when
she returned to the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough, Billy. Jimmy Dorr and
George Packard are coming.&#8221; She was a
sensible woman, yet she disliked to expose her
boy to Jimmy&#8217;s caustic tongue. But Billy
was equal to more than Jimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em come. What do I care for Sour &#8217;n
Shifty? I&#8217;ll never desert Micawber this near
success.&#8221; He rubbed on calmly, and the two
boys came in at the open door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Billy! You washin&#8217; floors?&#8221; There
was a sneer in Jimmy&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; Billy looked up from all fours and
grinned. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t got two able-bodied sisters
like Vilette an&#8217; Echo to work for me; and you
wouldn&#8217;t have me see my mother do it, would
you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>Mrs. Bennett did not know, as her son did,
that the retort touched a sore fact. Jimmy&#8217;s
eyes darkened with the look that had earned
for him the name of &#8220;Sour.&#8221; Yet in spite of
this he had a fine, strong face.</p>

<p>Billy went on with his rubbing, and his next
words were comically resigned. &#8220;Besides, I
suppose I&#8217;ll have to get married some day;
of course she&#8217;ll be a new woman; might as
well learn housework now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jimmy&#8217;s face lost its scorn. Someway the
sting of his sarcasm never seemed to touch
Billy, who could always strike back a surer if
less venomous blow. Perhaps that was the
very reason why Jimmy, though larger and
older, sought Billy and heeded him as he did
no other save his own stern father.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t catch Billy asleep,&#8221; said George,
siding with the victorious.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must go right back,&#8221; Jimmy declared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
turning to the door of the kitchen and thrusting
a package within.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tremendous long visit,&#8221; Billy taunted;
&#8220;what&#8217;d you come for? Another donation
for my new sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>George nudged Jimmy. &#8220;Hit again, Sour.
Come on.&#8221; The two boys went out, mysteriously
embarrassed.</p>

<p>Billy went to the door and looked after them.
No one was in sight. Harold, the twins, and
May Nell, too, were gone. What could it
mean? He looked back at the clock. Nearly
ten. Usually the Gang gathered earlier than
this, hung around and hurried him with his
work, many putting in lusty strokes, that Billy,
the favorite, might the sooner be released.
But now even Jean, his stanch second in all
the fun going, was late. He had expected to
be late himself; he always was. But he, who
planned most of the sport in spite of doing more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
work than any of them, had this day expected
his schemes to be well launched before he could
join in them.</p>

<p>He was standing disconsolate, looking up the
street for stragglers, when his mother came in
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Billy? Why don&#8217;t
you go and play? You surely deserve a fine
holiday, my big, big son.&#8221; She put her arm
around him tenderly; and he saw that she
remembered. He would be thirteen to-morrow.
He had been counting the days; but he thought
mother and sister had been too busy to think
of it. It was coming&mdash;to-morrow, Sunday! If
he didn&#8217;t have a good time to-day it wouldn&#8217;t
be any birthday at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p0044-illus.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Billy To-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t the Gang come, mamma?&#8221;
he asked, returning the kiss he knew was one
ahead for his natal day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you go down to the creek,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
replied with a peculiar smile. &#8220;May Nell and
the twins went there some time ago. Harold,
too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Billy ran off full of vague expectation born of
his mother&#8217;s smile. No one in all the country
round, not even Harold Prettyman, whose
father had the finest farm in Vine County, had
such a splendid place to play as the Bennetts&#8217;
back lot that sloped down to Runa Creek. As
Billy slammed the gate and bounded out on a
huge boulder that hung over the creek, a sounding
cheer greeted him from below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooray, Billy! Thirteen to-morrow! But
this is the day we celebrate!&#8221;</p>

<p>There they all were; those who had come
first to the house, and many others: Jean, Bess
Carter, Charley Strong, Max Krieber, Jackson
Carter, the little colored boy, standing aloof,
and others, large and small. All in a line they
stood, and shouted up at him:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Billy To-morrow?
He&#8217;s thirteen! Three and ten! Most a man!
He&#8217;s all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a minute Billy stood, dazed, his heart
thumping hard. Then he threw his cap in the
air, sang out, &#8220;Bully for the Gang! This time
it&#8217;s Billy To-day!&#8221; and raced down the hill to
join them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="nobreak">
CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE SURPRISE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;WELL, what do you want to play?&#8221; Billy
asked, after the hubbub had a little
subsided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go to the park and play football,&#8221;
Jimmy responded quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the girls and small fry can&#8217;t come in on
that. Besides, that little city kid&#8217;ll be lonesome
if I leave her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well I&#8217;m not going to stay an&#8217; play kid
games,&#8221; Jimmy retorted loftily, and turned
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me neither,&#8221; George endorsed.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Billy acquiesced with a nonchalant
tact; &#8220;I thought Sour&#8217;n Shifty&#8217;d
make good surveyors, Pretty; but I guess you
can do that an&#8217; your own job too, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;
Billy turned to Harold, while George watched to
see what Jimmy did.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>&#8220;Surveyors? What&#8217;s your scheme?&#8221; Jimmy
was quickly interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;d planned a big stock concern, like
business men. We&#8217;ll build a railroad, telegraph
line&mdash;that comes first, though; we&#8217;ll have
gold and copper mines, and a wharf. And next
we&#8217;ll launch the steamer we&#8217;ve been making.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>If</i> she steams,&#8221; Harold put in sagely.</p>

<p>&#8220;That big sand pile the kids made last week
for a fort can be the Sierras, and we&#8217;ll tunnel,
and have a loop, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where does our fun come in? Girls
don&#8217;t build railroads,&#8221; Bess complained.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but you can ask concessions, and buy
stocks, and keep hotel in the shack, an&#8217; board
us men. Make more money &#8217;n we do. They
always do, you know; not the fellers that
works, but the smart ones that work <i>them</i>.
I&#8217;m hungry enough to eat May Nell right now!&#8221;
He snapped his teeth together with a ferocious
grin as the little girl came near; and she laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
back at him more joyously than her mother
would have believed possible could she have
known; for this wholesome out-of-door frolic
was a boon to the child, white from life within
brick walls.</p>

<p>They were a happy lot. Each held some
high-sounding position, the name coined in
Billy&#8217;s busy brain. His box of abused tools
came forth; the much mended wheelbarrow,
picks, shovels wobbly from use as well as abuse,
improvised things that only an imagination as
large as Billy&#8217;s could have named tools,&mdash;something
for each one there.</p>

<p>Along the ridge of soft sand left by receding
waters Billy let his first contract to Harold, who
immediately marshalled the &#8220;kindergarten&#8221;
with their broken fire shovels, kitchen spoons,
what not, and set them to digging briskly.
&#8220;Straight to the line, mind you,&#8221; he sang out
from time to time, as he set his pins along the
line the &#8220;engineers had run.&#8221; Max was superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of telegraph construction; and Charley
Strong, &#8220;the Strong Man,&#8221; and Jackson
contracted for the tunnel. They were to start
from each side, meet exactly in the middle
in sixty days,&mdash;a minute stood for a day,&mdash;or
pay five million dollars fine. And over all
Billy kept a watchful eye, cast the glamour of
his eager spirit.</p>

<p>What matter if the telegraph poles that were
to be just twelve feet&mdash;that is, twelve inches&mdash;fell
short or long sometimes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their knifes bin too dull, and she must
quick be done,&#8221; Max apologized to Billy on his
inspection trips.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll play there&#8217;s a strike in the saw-mills,
Dutchy, and this is scab labor,&#8221; Billy excused
amiably. And for a fact the white cotton
string carried the messages quite safely from
the &#8220;Front,&#8221; where Jimmy and George laid
out the &#8220;line&#8221; over wonderful grades, across
impossible gorges; and &#8220;wired&#8221; back for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
further orders. Harry Potter was the operator
at the &#8220;Front,&#8221; and Vilette,&mdash;&#8220;Women do
operate, you know,&#8221; she said,&mdash;Vilette was the
proud holder of &#8220;the key&#8221; at Headquarters,
where Clarence Hammond strutted around as
Messenger; and because he was the &#8220;son of the
Boss,&#8221; bullied his Cousin Harry unmercifully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Geegustibus! You kids are doin&#8217; a fine
job,&#8221; Billy encouraged, as he walked by the
line of little bending, sweating backs. &#8220;There
never was a railroad built on the square like
this. Contractors on time; men a-workin&#8217;
that&#8217;s got brains an&#8217; ain&#8217;t afraid to use &#8217;em.
Jiminy crickets, it&#8217;s fine!&#8221;</p>

<p>Every back bent a little lower. Every face
flushed a little rosier under its coat of grime.
Praise from Billy was all they asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I must get at my job, too. That&#8217;s
thinking up things. You fellers do your work
an&#8217; get your money; but I got to rustle that
money or bust.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>&#8220;O Billy, it hurts the ears of my mind to
hear you say those vulgar words.&#8221; May Nell,
playing &#8220;man&#8221; for the first time in her life,
looked up from the &#8220;rod of grade&#8221; that she was
piling deftly with a broken shingle. The color
from sun and exercise added much to her
beauty. She was neither blowsy nor smudged
like the other children, and her lawn frock was
as spotless as in the morning.</p>

<p>Billy looked at her thoughtfully, wondering
why her fearless criticism did not displease him;
lifted his battered hat and mussed again his
tousled hair. &#8220;All right, Fair Ellen, I&#8217;ll try
to obey the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady of the Lake?&#8221; she finished quickly in
a question. &#8220;Do you know that, too? I love
it.&#8221;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;&#8216;One burnished sheet of living gold,</div>
<div class="verse">Loch Katrine lay beneath him rolled,&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>she quoted glibly. &#8220;I know a lot more of it.
Do you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>A scream from &#8220;the shack&#8221; stopped further
quotations. Billy ran up the hill to learn the
trouble. Only Evelyn was there in the little
house built, half of boards, half of willow twigs
woven lattice-wise, against a huge smooth rock.
Beside this rock also ascended a cobble chimney;
and the fireplace, roughly plastered,
served its purpose well. Billy had made it all,
and Edith wished the house fireplace would
draw as well.</p>

<p>He found Evelyn on her knees before a hot
fire, bravely trying to hold level one of the
several pots that were sizzling there. Her
drooping hair smothered her small hot face,
and perspiration stood like dew on her anxious
little upper lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Kiddie? Gee! Those
big girls ought not to leave you alone with that
fire; you&#8217;ll be cooked before the grub!&#8221; he
grumbled while he mended the fire and propped
the kettle. &#8220;Yum, yum! Things a-doin&#8217; here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Makes a feller&#8217;s stomach feel like just before
Thanksgiving dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evelyn relieved of her fear of the tottering
kettle, roused to her charge. &#8220;Go &#8217;way, Billy!
Thank you, Billy. You mustn&#8217;t stay here!
They&#8217;ll scold me. They said for me not to let
you come; an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, I&#8217;d like to know? Isn&#8217;t this
my shack? And shall I let a kid burn up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s a secret,&#8221; she whispered in smothered
distress. &#8220;Please to go!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Billy seeing sweet potatoes sticking out
of hot ashes, and other luxuries in evidence,
concluded that some business was &#8220;doin&#8217; among
the girls,&#8221; where he wouldn&#8217;t be welcome. He
went back to the &#8220;Front,&#8221; where some of the
contractors were having a violent altercation
over the meaning of certain specifications. The
Boss soon arbitrated successfully, and things
moved &#8220;lively&#8221; for a short time, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
banging of a dishpan announced dinner at &#8220;the
hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right this way, ladies and gentlemen,&#8221;
Bess called from the edge of the far terrace.
&#8220;A dinner fit for the gods, ambrosia and nectar;
gifts from Flora and Fornax! Come up to the
garden of the gods and goddesses and feast
together!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bess, though not quite twelve, was a striking
girl, larger than most women; with a mind as
unusual as her body. Poetry, music, mythology,
she fed upon these as a plant upon the sunshine.
She was not satisfied with ordinary
speech, but continually wove into the most
commonplace events the glamour of romance
and poetic words. A wise mother had stood between
her and the jeers of the thoughtless, that
she might have a normal girlhood; and Billy&#8217;s
mother and sister helped to make it possible
for her to play comfortably with those of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
own age. Yet it was a surprise to the stranger
to see this dark-eyed, magnificent woman-creature
in short skirts romping with children.</p>

<p>To-day she was happy. It had fallen to
her to general this great feast that Billy&#8217;s mates
had planned for the celebration of his birthday.
All had contributed. Not only the girls had
cooked&mdash;Jean had baked a big cake, Jackson
had made the candy, and Jimmy and
George had sneaked up from the &#8220;Front,&#8221; and
set up the long table in the arbor.</p>

<p>According to plan, Billy&#8217;s mother had called
and detained him while the score of laughing
youngsters gathered and stood silently around
the table. When he was running across the
lawn again, his face washed and hair combed,
matters he thought might well have been
omitted when time was so precious, he was
struck by the strange stillness. What had
happened to stop every tongue at once? He
ran on faster, through the trellis gate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
halted, transfixed. A shout greeted him. Each
one waved a small flag, and sang lustily&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">&#8220;Where have you been, Billy Boy, Billy Boy?</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, where have you been, charming Billy?&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>He looked at the beaming faces, at the beautiful
table with Jean&#8217;s great pagoda cake in the
centre, the dates, 1893-1906, in evergreen;
at the flowers everywhere; at the dishes,&mdash;they
usually ate from vine leaves at their out-of-door
feasts,&mdash;at the paper napkins folded
fantastically and hovering over the table like
gay butterflies. His eloquent face told his
surprise, his gratitude, his delight. He opened
his mouth to speak some fitting word, but it
wouldn&#8217;t come. He tried again, for he felt
the occasion called for something formally appreciative.
But only a whimsical idea flitted
into his mind; and he sang back&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent4">&#8220;I&#8217;ve not been to seek a wife,</div>

<div class="verse">For I&#8217;m a young thing and cannot leave my mother.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>A gleeful yell greeted his paraphrase. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
they ate it all came out, how they had planned
and executed. Harold had peas and strawberries
hidden in his mysterious basket, freshly
gathered by his own hands that morning.
George and Jimmy had furnished and dressed
the chickens, and the girls had roasted them&mdash;with
a little supervision from Mrs. Bennett&mdash;in
the Yukon camping stove that belonged to
Harry&#8217;s mother. Bess had given the dishes,
blue and white enamel, strong as well as
good to the eye, and ready for many another
frolic.</p>

<p>Max furnished the milk. &#8220;I haf gif mine cow
much sugar to make dot milk sweet for Pilly
to-day,&#8221; he explained happily to Mrs. Bennett.</p>

<p>And so the story went on. All the wholesome
things of the country that children like
had come from one and another. And each
had been as happy in giving as Billy could
possibly be in receiving.</p>

<p>Bess, an only child, was usually present at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
frequent entertainments her parents gave, and
was familiar with some of the more formal table
customs. She wished Billy&#8217;s dinner to have
every dignity, and to this end rose and proposed
a toast to him. They drank it standing, with
cheers. And Billy, accustomed to having the
largest voice in every noise, stood and joined
lustily; till Jackson, who helped his father at
the catering for lodge banquets, and knew a
thing or two, reached behind Jean and pulled
the back of Billy&#8217;s coat violently. &#8220;Pst! Set
down!&#8221; he hissed, tragically.</p>

<p>And Billy, suddenly remembering who was
being cheered, slid to his seat sheepishly, a cold
feeling down his back, uncomfortable heat in
his cheeks.</p>

<p>Jean changed the situation by proposing a
toast to Billy&#8217;s new sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Half-sister, step-sister, persister, or sister-in-law&mdash;&#8221;
Jimmy began, when Billy&#8217;s frown
stopped him, and Bess interrupted with, &#8220;He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
thinks he&#8217;s saying something witty: laugh
everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jean spoke at once and heartily.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s to our latest addition. May she never
be subtracted from us. Already she&#8217;s multiplied
our joys, yet we hope she&#8217;ll not have
to divide our woes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jimmy was the first to stand and cheer.</p>

<p>May Nell sat still and smiled modestly.
Billy stared at her, feeling still more foolish
over his own mistake.</p>

<p>Presently Jimmy and George slipped away
and quickly returned bearing a huge freezer,
Mrs. Bennett following. Now Billy knew what
she had done with the cream.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only your notion, Billy, that mother&#8217;s
cream is best; but I&#8217;ve been very happy making
it for you.&#8221; She began at once to serve it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, you&#8217;re a wise guy. This beats
Maskey&#8217;s,&#8221; Harold declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any Maskey&#8217;s any more,&#8221; May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Nell mourned; &#8220;just ashes and old irons where
used to be such oceans of goodies in such beautiful
boxes and dishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>All were silent for a little. Most of them had
been more than once to San Francisco&#8217;s celebrated
dealer in sweets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know how ice cream is made, May
Nell?&#8221; Jimmy asked to break the oppression.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; will you tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First they feed the cow a barrel of sugar,
then they freeze her, after that milk her; and
there you have your ice cream.&#8221;</p>

<p>May Nell looked incredulous. &#8220;And they
feed her strawberries and vanilla beans and
chocolate for flavors, I suppose; but how do
you separate them when you milk? Will you
show me the next time you fill that big bucket?&#8221;
She nodded her head toward the freezer, and
was so demure that not even Bess, still less
Jimmy, knew whether she was deceived or
poking fun.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>May Nell was astonished at the country appetites,
astonished at her own; yet the cream also
disappeared; after which Bess, the magnificent,
rose, waved her hand theatrically toward Mrs.
Bennett, and declaimed,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">&#8220;Here&#8217;s to our mothers,</div>
<div class="verse">Better than all others,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose feet never tire,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose hearts never&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Just then mischief took possession of Harry
Potter. He dropped a paper parcel behind
Vilette, and a little green snake wriggled out
and ran under the table. Vilette only grinned,
but May Nell saw it, screamed and grew white.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh! It ran&mdash;across my&mdash;foot!&#8221; she
gasped, and fell over.</p>

<p>Confusion followed. Harry was struck with
a great fear. Was she dead? He had never
seen a girl do so before. Would they hang
him?</p>

<p>But May Nell recovered almost before Mrs.
Bennett had time to lift her. &#8220;I often do&mdash;do&mdash;faint,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
she apologized, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t&mdash;isn&#8217;t
&#8217;t all dangerous.&#8221; She smiled at Mrs. Bennett,
and the smile, the sweet, pale little face with
her hair a shining golden halo around it, made
of her an ethereal being almost unreal to the
awestricken children. Yet she was soon merry
again, apparently as well as ever.</p>

<p>The hours passed in an uproar of fun. The
table was dismantled, toys, tools, and dishes
put away, and the feast had sped into the past.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been the best ever,&#8221; Jean said, happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;A perfectly gorgeous occasion,&#8221; Bess supplemented.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bulliest time yet!&#8221; shouted Charley
from the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine stomach ist so full mine head cannot
t&#8217;ink,&#8221; Max stammered to Mrs. Bennett; &#8220;but
it vas bravo!&#8221;</p>

<p>They all went off, a merry, noisy troop. And
the disappearing sun was the last to say to
Billy &#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>

CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE TWO-LIGHT TIME</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">SUNDAY brought rain, and Mrs. Bennett
decided that May Nell must remain quietly
in the house. The only apparent result of her
exciting day, and the faint, was a languor that
made her willing to obey, to curl up by the fire,
with Sir Thomas by her side. He was a tremendous
cat, who accepted lazily all the caresses
bestowed upon him, while Flash, his white mate,
was shy, and unless forced, would not appear
before strangers.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re great frauds, those aristocratic cats
of sister&#8217;s,&#8221; Billy explained; &#8220;not a bit of use.
They won&#8217;t fight, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Billy, think how many gophers Flash
catches, and what gentlemen they are in the
house,&#8221; Edith defended. She was chorister for
one of the churches, and was now gathering
her music.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>&#8220;You never give my cats a chance,&#8221; Billy
complained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we have, Billy,&#8221; Mrs. Bennett corrected.
&#8220;Bring them in now. Let May Nell
see our entire cat family.&#8221; She followed him
out, and presently returned with a plate of cut
meat which she placed on a newspaper on the
hearth.</p>

<p>&#8220;A cat tablecloth!&#8221; the little girl laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s for Billy&#8217;s cats; mine need none,&#8221;
Edith declared.</p>

<p>The child reared without pets was delighted
with the animal life about her; the cats, old
Bouncer, the white chickens, and pigeons cooing
in the loft.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett called. The cats walked leisurely
to the hearth, sat down, one on either
side, and began to eat, each from his own side
of the plate. They were as deliberate and
dainty as well-bred children.</p>

<p>Billy entered with a cat under each arm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
&#8220;Geewhillikins,&#8221; he introduced, &#8220;the best
fighter in town,&#8221; and put down a stub-tailed,
gray cat, half as large as the house pets, with
&#8220;tom-cat&#8221; speaking from every hair of him.
&#8220;I think mamma&#8217;s partial,&mdash;she lets sister&#8217;s
cats come in the house, but not mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geewhillikins did not wait for four feet to be
on the floor to spring at the plate. He put his
paws on one pile of meat, and began to gobble
the other, growling savagely. The house cats
drew back, curled their tails around their forefeet,
and looked at the gorger in calm disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t noticed Jerusalem Crickets,
yet,&#8221; Billy said impressively, anxious to distract
attention from the little drama at the plate.
He placed his second cat on the floor, a gaunt
creature, brindled in many colors, with great
scared-looking eyes. &#8220;She&#8217;s afraid of everybody.
She never had any home till I brought
her here, poor thing! Just kicked from door
to door. And Geewhillikins, too&mdash;he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
tiny kitten put in a sack to drown out in the
creek. And he was so plucky he just wiggled
to shallow water and hollered for a deliverer.
Of course that kind of cats don&#8217;t have manners.
How could they?&#8221; Billy was a fine special
pleader.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a real little cat Moses, wasn&#8217;t he?
And you&mdash;you must be Pharaoh&#8217;s son instead
of daughter.&#8221; The child laughed and clapped
her hands.</p>

<p>Meantime Jerusalem Crickets, escaped from
Billy&#8217;s arm and eye, was sneaking about for
prey; and a clinking sound from the pantry
warned them that she had found it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run, Billy! You left the door open&mdash;she&#8217;ll
get the dinner!&#8221; Mrs. Bennett cautioned,
hurrying out herself to reckon the loss.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a chop left from yesterday,&#8221; he
excused on his return.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might have been to-day&#8217;s roast,&#8221; Edith
protested, as she took the snarling Geewhillikins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
from his feast. &#8220;You see why Billy&#8217;s cats
don&#8217;t come in the house, May Nell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you forget their breakfast, Billy?&#8221; the
child questioned earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Billy never forgets his cats,&#8221; his sister
answered for him; &#8220;though the chickens might
sometimes suffer but for mamma. Take your
ill-bred felines out, Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He obeyed, talking whimsically to his pets
as he went.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flash and Tom wouldn&#8217;t touch meat left
on the table alone with them for a day,&#8221; Edith
said as she replenished the plate, shook and
folded away the paper, and called her cats.</p>

<p>They walked up as before, and ate slowly,
piece by piece, neither touching a morsel on
the opposite side of the division line. Sir
Thomas finished first, and looked on while
Flash minced more daintily. He did not eat
all, but walked off to the plush-cushioned chair
they claimed as their own. Sir Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
watched him curl up and rest his nose on his
white forepaws, then quickly finished the rest
of the meat and joined him. And now such a
toilet began. Each groomed the other; yet,
as always, Tom tired first while Flash worked
on till they both shone like silk, when he put
his long arms about Tom, nestled his head close
down, and both slept.</p>

<p>The little girl forgot herself in watching them,
till Billy came in, smart and almost handsome
in his best suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are your going to church?&#8221; she asked, disappointment
drawing her lips to a tremulous
curve.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to help sister, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t ten o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sunday School comes first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sunday School, too? How long you&#8217;ll be
away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy made no reply. He wondered if he
ought to stay at home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>&#8220;Do you like it, Sunday School, I mean? I
don&#8217;t. I like church, though,&mdash;the great booming
organ, the beautiful singing. And when
the minister speaks I just float away into fairy-land
and never come back till he says, &#8216;The-Lord-make-his-face-to-shine-upon-us-amen.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like Sunday School best &#8217;cause I do things
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sec&#8217;etary; and I pass the books, and
sing; and I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m giggle squelcher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a funny word! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you see,&#8221; Billy hesitated, for he was
modest, &#8220;sister has a class of us heathen boys,
and&mdash;well, you see, it&#8217;s this way; sister says,&mdash;she&#8217;s
partial, you know,&mdash;she says I have
influence; if I don&#8217;t giggle the others won&#8217;t,
and she gets on O. K.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How splendid! You must go, Billy. Do
all the boys mind you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All but Sour; an&#8217; sister&#8217;s fixed him. He&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
crazy over music, and she got his father to let
him take lessons, and that kid&#8217;s her slave ever
since. But it isn&#8217;t minding, Ladybird; the
guys take my cue, and we tell things we&#8217;ve
hunted up in the week about the lesson; and
sister tells things, and we&#8217;re so busy we forget
to be silly.&#8221;</p>

<p>May Nell looked at him a minute before
speaking. &#8220;You like doing things, but you
don&#8217;t like work. Isn&#8217;t work doing things?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy stooped to tie shoestrings already tidy;
he was gaining time for thinking. &#8220;I reckon
doing things you don&#8217;t like is work, and doing
things you do like is play,&#8221; he explained,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;But some people like their work, don&#8217;t
they?&#8221; May Nell persisted. She was exploring
strange country.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so. Teacher says every live thing
that&#8217;s happy works; birds, flowers, children;
that those that won&#8217;t work shouldn&#8217;t eat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
He says the greatest joy is to do the work you
like best as well as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never worked,&#8221; May Nell said reminiscently;
&#8220;but there&#8217;s one hard thing I&#8217;ve
done&mdash;I&#8217;ve kept very still when mama has
her headaches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whack! That&#8217;s the hardest work of
all,&#8221; Billy complimented.</p>

<p>Edith came in dressed for church.</p>

<p>&#8220;My conscience! How lovely and stylish
you look!&#8221; The child, accustomed to elegant
dress, praised with discriminating eyes.</p>

<p>When brother and sister left her, strange
thoughts flitted through her head. She heard
Mrs. Bennett beating eggs in the kitchen; saw
the logs Billy had piled in the wood-box. On
the wall above the piano hung Edith&#8217;s schedule&mdash;time
table, Billy called it. May Nell had
already studied it, had seen the fifty or more
lessons set for each week; and needlework on
the music table, and books there the child had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
discovered were for music study,&mdash;these told
her what a busy woman Billy&#8217;s sister must be.</p>

<p>Yet it was very strange, they were all happy!
Happier, she felt, than her own mother with
maids and money, gems, rich gowns, and her
motor car at command. Why was it? &#8220;Those
that won&#8217;t work shouldn&#8217;t eat.&#8221; Could that
be true? Then she should not eat, for she never
worked. She wondered how it would seem to
work.</p>

<p>Full of her thought she slipped from the
couch, and went to the kitchen. &#8220;Mrs. Bennett,
haven&#8217;t you some work a little girl could
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>The divining woman looked into May Nell&#8217;s
beautiful eyes, too deep and thoughtful for her
slender body; drew her close and kissed her.
&#8220;Yes, dear, just the nicest sort of work for a
little girl. You may hull these strawberries;
and if you eat some for toll I shan&#8217;t be looking.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child seeing the twinkle in the older eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
laughed aloud; and, wrapped in a voluminous
apron, began the first task that had ever left
its stain on her pretty fingers.</p>

<p>Her questions brought long and wonderful
tales of Billy&#8217;s younger life; of Edith when she,
too, was a little girl. The child helped to set
the table, carried in bread, salad plates, and jelly.
&#8220;It shakes like the fat woman at the circus
when she laughed. How do you make jelly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next month when currants are ripe you
shall see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And help?&#8221; May Nell asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why, it was going to be fine to work! Why
had she not known it before?</p>

<p>Services were over before she found time to
be lonely. Dinner passed happily. The cats
stayed quietly in their chair till dessert, when
they came, one on either side of Edith, and stood
with their forepaws on the table, their heads and
shoulders above it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;Flash has cake, Sir Thomas cheese,&#8221; Edith
explained, giving each his coveted bit. They
took the morsels from her fingers, ate them
delicately, and mewed once. &#8220;That&#8217;s &#8216;Thank
you,&#8217;&#8221; Edith interpreted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a hurry-up order for more,&#8221; Billy
amended.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more, kitties; that&#8217;s all that is good for
you. Go back to your chair.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked at her a minute, dropped reluctantly
to the floor, and retired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they know what you say&mdash;mind!&#8221;
May Nell exclaimed, admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obedience, thy name is cats,&#8221; Billy preached
solemnly.</p>

<p>It had stopped raining, but was still cloudy.
This was the hour when Billy usually wheeled
long miles by himself, dreaming dreams no one
but a boy knows how to dream. Nothing short
of a downpour ever hindered him; thus mother
and sister knew it was genuine self-sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
that kept him beside the little girl through
the long afternoon.</p>

<p>All his treasures, pictures, marbles, mineral
specimens, what not, were displayed and explained.
And finally came the books, when
Billy discovered that she knew most of his favorites,
loved them as he did, and could introduce
him to new ones that promised delight.</p>

<p>So the hours passed. The two women had
their quiet rest till five o&#8217;clock when they came
down for the usual singing. May Nell had a
sweet voice, surprisingly strong for a child;
and when she asked to play her own accompaniment
to a little song unknown to Edith,
the latter was surprised by the child&#8217;s skill, and
still more by her rare feeling and expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can dance, too,&#8221; she said with childish
pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sister, she&#8217;ll be hunkey for the fairy queen
in your Spring Festival, won&#8217;t she? She&#8217;s a
regular progidy, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; Billy&#8217;s eyes shone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>&#8220;Can he mean &#8216;prodigy,&#8217; do you think, May
Nell?&#8221; Edith&#8217;s eyes were mischievous.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mix up words that way sometimes, too,&#8221;
the child excused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for you, Ladybird. I&#8217;ve got a
backer you see, sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like &#8216;Ladybird,&#8217; but not &#8216;bully,&#8217;&#8221; the
little girl returned shyly.</p>

<p>Supper passed. Edith went to church, Billy
to keep an appointment with his teacher; and
the spring twilight settled down over the room.
Mrs. Bennett knew this would be a trying hour,
and hastened her work, inventing some light
task for May Nell; hastened also the errand to
her own room. Yet though she was gone but
a moment, on returning a sob greeted her from
the cuddled heap on the couch.</p>

<p>She took the child in her comforting arms.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, little one! We shall find her, never
fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is the time my mama needs me,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
May Nell sobbed; &#8220;Sunday night in the two-light
time, before the stars come out, really,
and when the shadow people creep from the
corners and blink at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t have any shadow people to-night,
darling.&#8221; Mrs. Bennett rose and turned on the
lights, though it was not yet dark; drew the
curtains, and punched the fire till a storm of
sparks sputtered up the chimney.</p>

<p>&#8220;My papa told me to be a very brave little
girl, and no matter what happened to take care
of my mama. And now&mdash;I&#8217;ve l-lost her;
and my braveness is all leaking away.&#8221; She
covered her face with her hands and sobbed
bitterly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett hugged her closer and patted
her cheek softly, but let the passion of tears
spend itself a little before trying the comfort
of words. Then she questioned of the child&#8217;s
parents, her past life, and the events just preceding
the catastrophe in San Francisco, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
she herself might better understand how to
shield and make happy the little waif that a
terrible, heaving earth had cast into her home,
her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa went away to South America when I
was eight. He told me I must be very wise
and help mama to do what was right,&mdash;sometimes
she does take my advice, you know.
I&#8217;ve tried to be brave so God would bring her
back to me; but my braveness isn&#8217;t very
strong yet, or I wouldn&#8217;t cry so, would I?&#8221;
she questioned, with a teary little smile.</p>

<p>Not all at once but slowly, with mother&#8217;s
tact, Mrs. Bennett won the little heart to partial
peace; and when the gate clicked, and
Billy&#8217;s voice was heard, she was almost gay.
&#8220;I must be laughing when they come in,&#8221; she
whispered, &#8220;so they won&#8217;t see the tears in my
eyes and think I am unthankful.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door opened on a smiling little face,
though she tried to keep in the shadow. Still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
when Billy kissed his mother good-night, caught
his sister in his arms and raced up and down
with her, singing extravagantly a snatch from
some opera, May Nell hid her face and cried
again.</p>

<p>Watchful Mrs. Bennett was not far away.
She stopped the boy&#8217;s noise, and cuddled the
bereft one once more. &#8220;What is it, child?
You are to be brave, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-yes, b-but how can I when I have no one
to say &#8216;mama&#8217; to, only a Mrs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have, you have, dear baby! I&#8217;ll be
your mother, and you can call me &#8216;mamma&#8217;
as Billy does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re my Ladybird sister,&#8221; Billy
said, very softly for him, and threw his arm
about them both.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, darling, I know how to find your
mother,&#8221; Edith encouraged, brushing her own
moist eyes, and clasping them all in her round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
young arms. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have your picture taken,
and get it in all the papers&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just like a football champion,&#8221; Billy interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, like a prima donna,&#8221; his sister retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather like a dear little girl, that so will
find her mother,&#8221; Mrs. Bennett reassured.</p>

<p>Amid the wealth of love how could the little
heart refuse comfort? Billy tossed her to his
shoulder and carried her to his mother&#8217;s room,
where both women coddled her and Edith sang
her into a sweet sleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE FAIR ELLEN</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">LITTLE by little they learned something of
May Nell&#8217;s story. Her mother had intended
to start for New York on the morning of the
earthquake, having been called there by her
own mother&#8217;s illness. Mrs. Smith, though held
to the last by household business, had let her
little daughter go to visit a widowed aunt and
cousin, who lived in a down-town hotel, and
who were to bring May Nell to meet her mother
at the Ferry Building the next morning. But
where at night had stood the hotel with its
many human lives housed within, the next
morning&#8217;s sunshine fell upon a heap of ruins
burning fiercely. A stranger rescued May Nell,
though her aunt and cousin had to be left
behind, pinned to their fiery death.</p>

<p>All that dreadful day the man searched for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the little girl&#8217;s mother, but their house was early
prey to the flames, and he could get no trace
of her. He was only passing through the city;
and having fortunately saved his money and
tickets, was anxious to be on his way across
the Pacific. Consequently nothing better
offered than to send the child with other refugees
to the kind hospitality of the country.</p>

<p>Edith had quickly put her plan in execution,
aided by the willing newspapers; but so far
nothing had come of it, and mother and daughter
feared their charge had lost more than aunt
and cousin. South America, a very definite
spot in the child&#8217;s mind, was still too vague a
postoffice address for even Uncle Sam&#8217;s marvellous
mail-carrying; and so, while encouraging
May Nell, the two women tacitly adopted
her into their hearts and discussed her future
as if she were their own.</p>

<p>It was a blessing that even her loyal soul
must yield to nature&#8217;s balm of passing time;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
in wholesome companionship and the fragrant
warmth of a country spring she somewhat forgot
the grief that would otherwise have worn
to death her frail little body.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mama doesn&#8217;t believe in public school,&#8221;
she had announced that first Monday morning;
but had gone obediently when Mrs. Bennett
decided it best. And the new life, the
stimulation of study, the competition in class,
her knowledge of books, and the prestige of her
story,&mdash;these made school a delight, brought
a happy light to her eye, a tinge of color to
her too fair cheek.</p>

<p>Her wardrobe was a heavy drain on Edith&#8217;s
purse, yet the young teacher delighted almost
as a mother in the dainty garments that won
her to extravagance.</p>

<p>Billy also undertook to do his share. A generous
sum of money had been offered to the
best student in the graduating class of the grammar
school; and he decided to try for it. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
when Billy made up his mind to anything connected
with books, it was as good as done. For
if he had to study a little harder than some, his
perseverance, added to an unusual facility in
telling what he knew, helped him to success.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett wished May Nell to be in the
open air as much as possible; and this meant a
new experience for Billy, which he accepted with
tolerable grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;A girl under foot all the time,&#8221; Shifty complained.
He had no sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you know the other thing to do if you
don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; Billy retorted, bluntly. &#8220;She&#8217;s
my sister till her folks are found, and that
isn&#8217;t likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if your steamer works you don&#8217;t want
its secrets peddled round; and girls always
blab.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only girl I&#8217;m afraid of in that
line. Isn&#8217;t that so, Pretty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; Pretty endorsed, inelegantly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>This conversation took place in Billy&#8217;s shop,
a room adjoining the wood-house and given over
to his use. Nothing short of the world in the
second verse of Genesis was equal to the chaos
of that place. Every conceivable scrap and
job lot of &#8220;truck&#8221; was there in a jumbled heap;
and Billy was never happier than when mussing
it over in search of &#8220;material&#8221;; in greasy overalls
and crownless hat, whistling merrily, bringing
forth to substance and form the inventions
of his busy brain.</p>

<p>The blandishments of soda water fountains,
candy stores, and other boyish temptations,
found no victim in Billy. But if Mr. Cooper,
the tinshop man, had driven hard bargains
he would have bankrupted the boy. As it was
his weekly allowance suffered in spite of Mr.
Cooper&#8217;s generosity and Billy&#8217;s free access to
a rich scrap heap at the rear of the big shop
where everything, one would say, in tin and
iron was made, from well pipe, tanks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
boilers, to tin wings for Edith&#8217;s fairies in the
opera.</p>

<p>Now a steamboat was on hand. At odd
times for weeks, Billy, Harold, and one or two
other boys, under secrecy of lock and key, had
been slowly bringing to completion a wonderful
structure.</p>

<p>Billy had intended naming it <i>The Jean</i>, but
Charley had stood for <i>Queen Bess</i>, Harold
didn&#8217;t like either name, and George and
Jimmy had objected to &#8220;girl kid names, anyway.&#8221;
They had, however, unanimously compromised
on <i>The Edith</i>, for Billy&#8217;s sister was
adored privately by all of his older friends,
adored openly and &#8220;tagged&#8221; by the little ones.
Edith, since May Nell&#8217;s coming, suggested her
name. The little girl agreed if it could be
Ellen; Billy added &#8220;Fair&#8221; with her permission;
and this name he painted over each
paddle wheel with no opposition from the
others.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>All was now ready for firing. &#8220;She&#8221; was
to be run by oil. They took her out through
the double doors, both swung wide for the first
time in many weeks. It was all the boys could
do to carry the heavy thing, though they went
quite steadily across the vegetable garden, not
without some damage to spring lettuce and summer
corn, however; but on the steep, uneven
slope below, the <i>Fair Ellen</i> came almost to grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bear up aft there!&#8221; Billy commanded; and
&#8220;Ay, ay, sir,&#8221; came back in equally nautical
language.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy, mates. Kids, belay there, till we
launch her!&#8221; This to the gaping youngsters
always in the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wharfmaster, ahoy!&#8221; Billy hailed, as they
came near the water&#8217;s edge. &#8220;Is all ship-shape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay, sir,&#8221; came this time from two boys
who had charge of some logs lashed together
and crossed and recrossed by a hash-like lot
of refuse lumber, and moored with a dog chain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>&#8220;Mother, do come and look at the procession,&#8221;
Edith called cautiously from the trellises, where
she was slyly watching.</p>

<p>Billy heard her, though. &#8220;Come on, sister,
mamma, too, and see the fun,&#8221; he called, not
unwillingly, for he was a bit proud of their work
now that it was out in the light of day. He
had reason; it was really an imposing craft for
boys to build from scraps.</p>

<p>A crowd of smaller children momentarily
increasing, capered about the sweating five.
Max bounded over the high fence, breathless,
fearing he would be late. Jean and Bess hurried
down the hill, each telling the other she
couldn&#8217;t spare the time for &#8220;just boys&#8217; foolishness.&#8221;
Jackson appeared on top of the
south stone abutment, halting there till Billy&#8217;s
hearty invitation brought him flying down into
the inclosure.</p>

<p>Bouncer barked at Billy&#8217;s heels. Geewhillikins
chased an imaginary foe down the hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and Jerusalem Crickets crept stealthily along
the upper support of the side picket fence,
trailing a venturesome sparrow.</p>

<p>Even the white chickens followed in a cackling
bunch as they always did when Billy appeared
at this hour, for it was almost feeding
time. And the pigeons wheeled and whirred,
lighting almost under foot only to be up and
off again, a flash of white and gray.</p>

<p>Behind the two women trotted a chubby
baby. &#8220;I see Billy boat,&#8221; he cried, shrilly,
stumbled, fell, scrambled up again, and repeated
his refrain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Buzz Lancaster, how did you get
here?&#8221; Edith went back and steadied him
over the uneven ground. &#8220;Phew! He smells of
gasoline! Where has he been, do you suppose,
mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I comed,&#8221; he said, calmly, &#8220;I see Billy
boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up, Buzz!&#8221; Billy called as he raced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
by from the shop, where he had been for the
oil can to fill the boat&#8217;s reservoir.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shan&#8217;t we defer the ceremonies till we can
get Charley&#8217;s little sister and Jackson&#8217;s two
weeks&#8217; old brother?&#8221; Jimmy asked, disagreeably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your grouch, Sour,&#8221; Harold expostulated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t call Jimmy &#8216;Sour,&#8217;&#8221; May Nell
pleaded. &#8220;He&#8217;s big and dark and splendid;
and his other name is going to be Roderick
Dhu; and he&#8217;ll be kind to all weak things,
and fight for the Douglases, and for the <i>Fair
Ellen</i>.&#8221; She waved her hand toward the
steamboat.</p>

<p>Jimmy tried not to look pleased, but failed.
Something about May Nell attracted him,
whether it was her beauty, her fearlessness,
or her air of distinction he did not know. It
was really her recognition of something fine
in him that his cold and irascible father had
almost whipped out of him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>&#8220;All ready?&#8221; cried Captain Billy. &#8220;Are
you ready, Ladybird?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Captain,&#8221; she answered, her eyes
aglow while she smoothed refractory frills.
She wore a wonderful trailing robe of tissue
paper, &#8220;ruffled to the guards,&#8221; Billy said. On
her head was a towering cap of the same; and
a light wind bellied out her wide angel sleeves
like sails before a spanking breeze.</p>

<p>She stood at the end of the creaking wharf,
and one little bare arm was lifted high. She
held a small fruit jar filled with water and beet
juice. It was awkward, but Billy had insisted
on the fruit jar,&mdash;&#8220;So&#8217;s it will be sure to break;
it&#8217;s the only kind of a bottle that always will
break.&#8221;</p>

<p>They fired up. An ominous sizz and clatter
began. Five pairs of hands shoved the smart
boat into the water at May Nell&#8217;s feet. The
children shouted. The dog barked and the
chickens cackled. And above all the din May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Nell&#8217;s sweet voice rang out, &#8220;I christen thee,
O wondrous vessel, <i>The Fair Ellen</i>.&#8221; She improvised
hastily; for no one had thought to
prepare a speech for the occasion.</p>

<p>The bottle went crash, and a furious yell informed
the neighborhood that the Gang was
&#8220;up to some new deviltry.&#8221;</p>

<p>But another and unexpected crash followed,
and a shower of burning oil shot up and caught
May Nell&#8217;s flimsy paper frock.</p>

<p>Yet before one could think, almost before
the paper had time to burn, Jimmy sprang to
her, seized her in his arms, tearing at the
shrivelling paper, and jumped far out over the
flaming boat into a deep pool.</p>

<p>For a horror-stricken moment no one spoke.
Even the dumb creatures were still; and Buzz,
thinking it all for his benefit, watched open-mouthed
for the next act in the play.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Bennett, fleet though speechless,
was at the water&#8217;s edge by the time Jimmy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
risen with May Nell quite safe. She spluttered
and choked a little; but Jimmy had been so
quick there was not even a red spot on her
flesh to show the touch of fire.</p>

<p>She was a queer draggled little creature, with
her soaked and tattered dress, and her yellow
curls all stringlets. Timidly she touched
Jimmy&#8217;s blistered hands, realized what he had
saved her from, and when she looked her gratitude
into his dark eyes something awoke in his
heart that never slept again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had very soon to fight for the Douglases,
didn&#8217;t you, Roderick Dhu?&#8221; she said, as
Mrs. Bennett covered her with an apron, and
Billy took her up and went toward the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, Roderick Dhu,&#8221; she called out
over Billy&#8217;s shoulder with another little choke,
for Jimmy had refused Mrs. Bennett&#8217;s offer of
dry clothes and was starting home alone.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p0094-illus.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Jimmy sprang for her</p>

<p>So imminent had catastrophe been, that no
one thought of the poor small steamer burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
unchecked to the water&#8217;s edge while the procession
climbed the hill; no one knew till days
afterward that busy Buzz had entered the open
shop and mixed Billy&#8217;s cans so that it was gasoline
instead of kerosene that he fed that fated
craft. But gratitude for Jimmy&#8217;s bravery and
May Nell&#8217;s safety supplanted even in the youngest
heart all regret for the boat.</p>

<p>All but May Nell; when Edith and Mrs.
Bennett rubbed and warmed her she declared
she didn&#8217;t need it, and was so absorbed in
lamenting the loss of the <i>Fair Ellen</i>, she could
think of nothing else.</p>

<p>&#8220;So long as it isn&#8217;t you, Ladybird, it&#8217;s all
right,&#8221; Billy consoled; &#8220;we can make more
boats.&#8221;</p>

<p>But May Nell was not to be comforted, till
that evening when she composed a wonderful
ode to &#8220;The Wreck of the <i>Fair Ellen</i>.&#8221;</p>

CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>&#8220;THE TRIUMPH OF FLORA&#8221;</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER the disaster of the <i>Fair Ellen</i>, Billy
promised his mother to bar explosives
from his play, a promise made readily, for
&#8220;Betsey has been giving it to me good an&#8217;
plenty for leaving that door open,&#8221; he explained
to her. Thus the Alaska trade which the boys
intended the <i>Fair Ellen</i> to wrest from Seattle,
thereby transferring some of her prosperity to
California&#8217;s stricken seaport, remained with the
northern metropolis; and they sought other
outlet for their energies.</p>

<p>Billy organized a real estate syndicate, and
sold lots to the Gang, &#8220;with or without liability
to assessment, as the purchaser prefers.&#8221; A
Board of Trade was organized to which all
promised to defer, except Jimmy, who smiled
in disdain. He leased the railroad and did a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
thriving carrying trade, timber for fencing and
warehouses, dirt for filling, and so on; and was
fast becoming &#8220;the millionaire of the crowd,&#8221;
when the &#8220;Board&#8221; met and decided he should
cut his tariff in half or leave the syndicate; and
as Jimmy was heartily interested in the game,
he accepted their decision and no longer smiled
at the Board of Trade.</p>

<p>Max, whose father was a gardener, knew
wizard&#8217;s tricks with seeds and soils; and as
Farmer and Forester to the syndicate, gave
his knowledge right and left with happy importance.
He taught the girls how to plan and
plant their flower beds, and started the boys
on a career of vegetable-raising that made them
feel rich before they began; talked trees to
Harold and other farmer boys, and astonished
his father by the questions he asked and the
work he did.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haf learn for gifing avay already, but I
feel more as rich dan if they haf gif to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
How ist dat?&#8221; Max asked himself, not knowing,
this little German lad so lately come to America,
that he had discovered one of the profoundest
secrets of the universe.</p>

<p>To his mother and sister Billy seemed changed.
He stuck closer to his books. His teacher told
them the boy stood at the head of his class.
&#8220;Jimmy Dorr may be a rival if he feels like
work, which isn&#8217;t probable. Jean&#8217;s accident
last year put her behind, otherwise the boys
would have to work much harder if either excelled
her.&#8221; Yet even these welcome words
did not account for some things the mother
quietly observed; Billy&#8217;s growing promptness,
better attention, and memory for matters outside
of play. He was more silent, too; and
there was less hammering and whistling in the
shop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, I don&#8217;t like the look of your eyes;
you&#8217;re reading too much at night,&#8221; his mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
said one evening when he was helping with the
dishes. &#8220;You must go to bed earlier.&#8221;</p>

<p>May Nell had learned to use the towel; and
the two children usually &#8220;did&#8221; the dishes at
night; but now she was away with Edith at the
Opera House, and mother and son were alone
in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Billy had been reeling off stanzas of his favorite
&#8220;Lady of the Lake,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;by the yard,&#8221; Mrs.
Bennett said, acting it as he recited, somewhat
retarding the work and endangering the dishes.
Now he dropped his towel, caught up his mother
and raced with her around the room. He was so
strong that she was almost helpless in his grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little bit of a woman! Do you think
I&#8217;ll mind you? I&#8217;m Roderick Dhu of Benvenue,
the bravest chief of all the crew! I&#8217;m
Captain Kidd, the pirate bold, whose treasure,
hid, lies yet in mould. I&#8217;m the strong man,
the bad&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>A lot more nonsense he rattled off, squeezing
and kissing her till she was breathless with
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re Fair Ellen and I&#8217;m defending
you at Goblin Cave!&#8221; He thrust her behind
him, held her tight with one arm, while he
flourished the carving knife and called on Clan
Alpine&#8217;s foes to appear.</p>

<p>But the moment of frolic passed, and he
turned to her with shining face. &#8220;You&#8217;re the
only mother I ever had&mdash;so far as I know&mdash;&#8221;
his eyes danced; &#8220;anyway, you&#8217;re the only one
in sight, an&#8217; a heap too good for this guy; I
guess&mdash;I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>His mood grew more thoughtful. He put
the dishes away quietly, and neither spoke again
till the work was finished. Then he went and
kissed her on the cheek. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to have
you all to myself, little mother; to be just
chums once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put back his tumbled hair, looked long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
into his eyes, realizing with a shock that she
was looking <i>up</i>. Her little boy was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t wish May Nell away, mother,
do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my son.&#8221; The answer was more sincere
than a few weeks before she could have
believed possible. The coming of the child
had taken from her life many hours of association
with Billy, sweet as only mothers know;
yet May Nell&#8217;s influence had softened and refined
Billy, enlarged his vision.</p>

<p>He tidied himself, bade his mother good-bye,
and followed the girls to rehearsal.</p>

<p>Sometimes all the small meanness of everyday
life is swept away by a great calamity, and the
world forgets to hate, and opens its great heart
of love. Such an event came through the catastrophe
in San Francisco. It inclined every
ear, moistened every eye. From all the
world&#8217;s pocketbook came the golden dollars;
from every soul the longing to do; and when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was done, disappointment because it was so
little.</p>

<p>Vina was no exception. Ball games, church
collections, children&#8217;s mite societies, girls sewing,
boys running errands, each and all helped
with the relief work.</p>

<p>When Edith planned to turn her pupils&#8217; recital
into a great Spring Festival, for the benefit
of the sufferers, all the town applauded, and
asked how it could help.</p>

<p>Edith worked very hard. She called her
operetta &#8220;The Triumph of Flora.&#8221; The words
were her own, written hurriedly and set to familiar
though classic airs. Yet many of the daintiest,
most tripping melodies she wrote herself.
The sorrows of humanity had winged her brain
and dipped her pen in harmonies, that she might
assuage them.</p>

<p>All went well with the preparation; and on a
glorious spring night in the full moon, the town
and countryside jammed the Opera House &#8220;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
its eyebrows,&#8221; Billy said, looking through the
peephole in the curtain to the high window
seats crowded with boys.</p>

<p>The operetta opened with a weird winter
scene, when the Sower (Harold) sowed his grain,
and the gnomes and elves set upon him; and
evoked Storm King (Jimmy), Wind (Bess), and
Frost (Jackson). He was the comedy of the
little drama; and dressed all in black, covered
with silver spangles and diamond dust, he made
a joke that the wine-growers appreciated, for it
is the black frosts of April they fear.</p>

<p>After these followed Jean as Rain. Wherever
she passed the singers bowed their heads
and sang more softly, and Frost retreated in
haste.</p>

<p>Billy was the sun, dressed in a pale yellow
tunic, and crowned with a fillet of sun-bursts
cut from gilt paper. He came but a little way
on the stage from the south for each of his short
solos; and the others pelted him back. Especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
did he hide from Rain behind Cloud, a
tall girl in a small ocean of gray tulle.</p>

<p>At the close of the act, in the far, high distance,
the Goddess, Flora, appeared on a hill-crest.
This was Edith herself, arrayed in a
filmy gown of pale green, garlanded with snow-drops
and buttercups. High, far, and faint
came her song of the dawn of Spring. But the
gnomes and the elves, Storm, Wind, Frost, and
Rain, roared and howled; and Flora, affrighted,
fled from view.</p>

<p>The curtain fell on the first act and the house
rocked with the noise. It is probable the
audience, predetermined to be pleased, would
have approved anything offered; but so far it
was more beautiful than had been expected.</p>

<p>The second act brought a conflict between
elves and gnomes, and the fairies, when first
the earth sprites were victorious, but at last the
fairies. May Nell was the Fairy Queen, and
enchanted all with her beauty, her dancing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
singing, and her acting, which was sweetly
childish as well as clever.</p>

<p>Flora came into view, clad in palest pink,
and wreathed with almond blossoms. Wherever
she stepped the ground was white with
almond snow. Gnomes and elves peeped from
behind gray rocks and tree-trunks, but fled as
she came near, following the ever-beckoning
fairies.</p>

<p>Sun, dressed this time in bright yellow satin,
and crowned with yellow gems, was surrounded
by fairies, and came more and more boldly
forward. He beckoned to Flora, menaced the
earth sprites, and threatened Storm, Wind, and
Frost; and at the close was rewarded by Flora&#8217;s
rejoicing cry,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">&#8220;I come! I come at thy call, O Sun!</div>
<div class="verse">Thy high commands shall quick be done.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The curtain fell a second time to still heartier
applause; and the long wait between the acts
was forgotten in discussion and approval. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
richest people in town had aided Edith with her
costuming and properties, that thus every penny
of the receipts might be saved for the great
purpose. They had brought out all their stores
of rich fabric, fine lace, jewels, and ornaments,
for the small mummers; and the effect was
entrancing.</p>

<p>The last act exhausted the possibilities of the
theatre in light effects and sylvan scenery; and
the curtain rose on a gorgeous scene. But oh,
horror! In the middle of the stage the scene-shifters
had left the ugly truck that moved
Storm King&#8217;s reservoir of ice and snow. When
used in previous acts, bed and wheels had been
hidden by moss, the tank had been covered by
his mantle, and the entire mechanism, moving
as he moved, had seemed a part of himself.
Now its secret was disclosed and it was ridiculous.</p>

<p>Edith in white, half smothered in blush roses,
with the fairies and their Queen, stood ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in the wings. Billy was also waiting his cue.
This time he was to be pulled swiftly in on invisible
wheels. Over his satin tunic was a network
of glittering mock gems that must have
included every yellow bead and spangle in Vine
County. From his shoulders floated a cloud
of yellow, diamond-dusted tulle; and the crown
of gems surrounded a cluster of small lights, a
device Billy himself had figured out with the
aid of the electric light man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Billy, Billy! My beautiful opera is
ruined!&#8221; Edith wailed, as she heard the jeers of
the small boys in the audience.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t, sister! I&#8217;ve thought of a way
out. Keep the kids straight here&mdash;I&#8217;ll be back
in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>This act opened with a hidden chorus that
lasted two or three moments, the fairies on the
one hand inviting the elves and gnomes to join
them; the others responding. While this was
in progress Billy rushed to the boys&#8217; dressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
room and talked furiously but straight to the
purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, fellows, business now, and no questions
asked. There&#8217;s a hitch on the stage. Storm,
wrap that cloak round you&mdash;don&#8217;t wait for
fixings&mdash;and get to your place in the wings,
quick! When I say &#8216;Go,&#8217; take Rain&#8217;s hand,
crouch low, run to the centre, and between you
yank that snow tank off the stage. <i>Sabe?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Across to the girls&#8217; side he flew. He knew
Jean. She would manage somehow, no matter
what the difficulty. And he did not trust her
without reason. She was already in her shining
misty robe that was to change her from Rain
to Dew; but she caught the gray mantle,
covered herself with it as she ran, and was in
the wings almost as soon as Billy.</p>

<p>He placed them before him, Rain and Storm,
took his great golden horn of plenty under his
arm, stepped on the wheeled board, signalled
the super, and rolled on, driving the crouching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
pair in front of him with pelting showers&#8217; of rose
leaves, and landing at his station just as the
chorus filed in. The gray pair threw their
shrouding mantles over the truck, and still
crouching pushed it out of sight; and the spectators,
believing they had laughed in the wrong
place, cheered vociferously, and never knew the
difference.</p>

<p>Rain dropped her gray mantle behind a tree,
and reappeared with her chalice of diamond-dust
dew, to touch the fairy chorus to shimmering
beauty. The gnomes, their queer masks
and hunched shoulders showing grotesquely
under their gray garb, joined the fairies&#8217; dance.
Wind came floating in as Summer Breeze.
Storm was transformed to the Slave of the
Sower; while Black Frost was perched high
up at the rear, grinning from the top of the
mountain.</p>

<p>The Sun called to Flora, and she appeared
by his side. In front of them knelt the Sower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
crowned with leaves. The Sun bestowed upon
him a cornucopia overflowing with cherries;
Flora laid on his other arm long sprays of roses.</p>

<p>The fairies, gnomes, and elves, danced, sang,
and retired; elves and gnomes crouching close
against trees and rocks, the fairies withdrawing
only to reappear one by one as the music went
on, here and there, high in the trees; and each
had a tiny light on her brow. But just over
Flora and Sun, poised and upheld by invisible
wires, stood the Queen of the Fairies, crown,
wand, and shoulders fire-tipped, her arms
waving, her filmy draperies continually fluttering,
fanned by an artificial breeze. Over
all fell a rain of rose leaves.</p>

<p>The scene ended in a crash of music; the
curtain fell to a house wild with cheering.
Edith and the principal performers were called
again and again before the curtain. It was
a generous, appreciative audience, giving its
heartiest approval by rising.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>Late that night when Billy&#8217;s mother followed
him to the Fo&#8217;castle, he asked, &#8220;Are you pleased
with it, little mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all splendid; and, Billy, I never
dreamed it was in you! Sister&#8217;s operetta would
have been a failure if it hadn&#8217;t been for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Jean and Jimmy, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stooped and kissed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good enough for me, then,&#8221; he said,
sleepily. And no one ever heard him mention
again his unexpected addition to the scene.</p>

CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE FIGHT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was a gray, cold day, unusual for May, the
kind of day that accords with ill-nature.
It reminded Billy of the incident of the opera
when Rain and Storm, driven by his own insistence,
had blown in on the stage quite out
of season, and dragged off with them the remnants
of winter. For the first Sunday since
May Nell&#8217;s coming he took his wheel after dinner
and went off alone. He was in accord with
the sullen sky and air. In the morning he had
answered his mother angrily; because Bouncer
wished to play instead of coming through the
gate when called, Billy had slammed it on his
tail, knowing well that in a happier mood he
would have been more careful.</p>

<p>Now he flew off down the county road at a
speed that made passers turn; but he saw no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
one. He neither slackened nor looked back till
he found himself at the river where the little
island rose, flower-crowned. The poppies were
fewer; and where a month before the flame-flower
had triumphed, to-day wild roses perfumed
the air.</p>

<p>Billy halted and looked up into the threatening
sky. His eyes twitched, and he noticed
wonderingly that his breath was short and his
hand shook on the handle-bar. He dismounted
and propped his wheel against the fence;
climbed down to the river and sat on a projecting
rock, with his feet dangling near the water.</p>

<p>There was a strange weight in his left side,
like lead. He felt as if the whole world was
against him; and the future looked dark and
terrible. Three days ago life had reached out,
a white shining road to success. Only three
days! He looked north to where clouds were
shutting down over the Mountain, gray to-day,
not blue. <i>The</i> Mountain, every one called it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
for it closed the valley and towered, a sentinel,
far above all other mountains in view. Billy
thought that stood for him; he was to be chained
to this narrow valley all his life; struggle as he
might he should never be free.</p>

<p>If he had been older he would have said he had
&#8220;the blues.&#8221; Yet probably he would not have
known that his mental&mdash;and physical&mdash;condition
was a natural result of the long strain of
previous weeks. All the children felt it. That
morning the cousins, Clarence and Harry, who
loved each other dearly, had come to blows in
the Sunday School room before the teachers
arrived, over the question of which one of them
should marry Miss Edith. Clarence received
a bloody scratch the full length of his palm
from Harry&#8217;s Band of Mercy pin; while the
careful parting disappeared from his own hair,
and a red splotch marred the whiteness of his
wide collar. No one can tell what further
calamity might have happened had not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Twins opportunely arrived and questioned of the
quarrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t fight any more,&#8221; Vilette said,
loftily; &#8220;we shall marry her ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we shall marry her ourselves,&#8221; Evelyn
echoed; while both girls made childish efforts
to rehabilitate the depressed cousins.</p>

<p>The unstinted praise of the children in the
operetta, the aftermath of buzz about the
&#8220;show&#8221; at school,&mdash;this excitement lasted for a
day or so; but on this lowering Sunday tired
nature put in a claim for her own; and relaxed
nerves were irritably near the surface.</p>

<p>Billy had the excitable musical temperament.
He spent his forces lavishly, and it was because
of this that he was a leader; could think and
act quickly in emergencies, as when he saved the
operetta from failure. Edith and her mother
knew that he had lived hard through the past
few weeks, that next to Edith herself he had
carried the entertainment, though Jean had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
been a host also. So it pleased Mrs. Bennett
that afternoon to see Billy start off alone for
the country.</p>

<p>Now in the silence and fragrance his tightened
springs began to relax. Presently he found
himself in a dream of possibilities of the island,&mdash;Ellen&#8217;s
Isle, he always called it; of what might
be done with the smooth places in the river,
the hills, Sunol Creek not far away, boiling
and tumbling in boisterous beauty; of hidden
nooks, piled boulders, and tiny meadows, vine-enclosed
and flower-fragrant.</p>

<p>Had he but dreamed on for an hour or so
he would have returned, rested, refreshed,
the cheery boy that helped to make the Bennett
house a home. But a voice in the road
above startled him. Only a word was spoken,
a greeting; but it was surly and foreign,
Italian.</p>

<p>Billy sprang up. The dark man of the sinister
house was passing on his way to town; had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
answered a horseman&#8217;s salute. The boy could
not see the house; but on the high hill above
it he saw the other brother, regardless of the
Sabbath, hoeing his vineyard.</p>

<p>Now was Billy&#8217;s chance! The place was
alone! He waited till each traveller was out
of view on the curving road, then climbed up,
crossed the dusty wheel tracks, and crept into
the brush on the other side. Once hidden
he &#8220;snooped&#8221; silently through the tangled
chaparral, coming shortly to the mystery-house,
so close to it that he could have looked
in at the windows had they been clean
enough.</p>

<p>A faint sound caught his ear, as of clinking
coins and soft voices. People there! He had
thought it before, now he was certain. Were
not both brothers away?</p>

<p>Billy cuddled down in the low-growing manzanitas,
whose screen was further thickened by
a tangle of wild pea vines all a-bloom. Placing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
himself so that he could watch both the house
and the man on the hill, he settled to await
further disclosures.</p>

<p>All the excited nerves in his body that had
been resting were tingling again. He could feel
his temples throb, count the beats of his heart.
For a time nothing happened. He heard no
different sounds, though he strained his ears
nervously. The moments passed and seemed
hours. He crouched motionless, but his stillness
was not repose.</p>

<p>What if they should find him? Gee!
Couldn&#8217;t a boy run faster than a man? Another
sound banished these thoughts; wheels
on the road, whose thick coat of dust almost
hushed the ring of metal tires. A horseman
before, and now a wagon; this was an unusual
amount of travel for that lonely road.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p0118-illus.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A faint sound caught his ear</p>

<p>Billy looked up at the Italian, saw him take a
pistol from his pocket, discharge it in the air,
replace it, and go calmly on with his work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
What could that be for? A warning? Yes;
for he realized suddenly that every sound in the
house had ceased. The wagon passed from
sight. He could hear the voices of the men as
they drove by, see the driver pointing to the
house with his whip; and one of the women
on the rear seat looked back as long as the house
could be seen. Then the soft mysterious sounds
began again.</p>

<p>Billy took no heed of time till he saw the man
above shoulder his hoe, pick up his wine jug,
and start down the hill. At that Billy&#8217;s heels
grew swift. He scurried out of his hiding place,
slipped rapidly through the brush, found his
wheel, and bowled off. No languor or heaviness
now in body or mind. Every atom of him was
alert as on the night of the opera, yet not so
normally alert; for the evil atmosphere of the
place was in his soul, filling his teeming brain
with imaginings of many crimes.</p>

<p>In this mood he turned into the main road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and came upon Jackson limping, bloody, and
crying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jiminy crickets! What&#8217;s happened, kid?&#8221;
Billy asked, slowing up beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sour&#8217;s licked me &#8217;cause I&#8217;m a n-nigger,
&#8217;n gave T-Twinnies some f-flowers an&#8217; walked
with &#8217;em. He&#8217;s back there now l-lickin&#8217; the
T-Twins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy didn&#8217;t wait. Like all generous natures
that are slow to anger, the passion once aroused
possessed him to madness. He raced down the
turnpike, his face aflame. Ahead he could
see the Dorrs&#8217; horse and buggy standing near
the fence. Jimmy was on the ground beside the
Twins; and Billy saw the whip descend more
than once before he arrived. Had he known it
the blows were make-believe, for moral effect
alone. Jimmy was giving a lesson that his
Southern breeding made him think necessary,
if painful.</p>

<p>Billy heard the pitiful cries of the children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Evelyn&#8217;s the loudest, though Vilette was receiving
the blows. Every drop of blood in
his veins was a spark of fire. An unsuspected
power came from somewhere, mysteriously.
He felt himself lift, expand, grow strong
enough to battle with an ox. He dropped
his wheel, sprang upon Jimmy from behind,
and bore him down. In an instant he had
snatched the whip, broken it, and tossed the
pieces into the field beyond. &#8220;You bully!
You skunk! To horsewhip girls! Why don&#8217;t
you take one of your own size?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jimmy was taken by surprise. Billy was his
favorite play-mate, and the whip had disappeared
before he realized the import of the
attack, and he thus lost any advantage he might
have gained while Billy&#8217;s hands were busy.
But the words roused Jimmy&#8217;s anger. No boy
had a right to interfere between him and his
sisters; and he struggled to his feet and launched
some telling blows.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>Billy heeded no prize-ring rules, no boys&#8217;
traditions of fair play. Every savage instinct
inherited from far-distant ancestors and sleeping
till to-day, rose, conquered the human in him,
for the moment made him brutish. And the
sobs of the little girls were as whips of fire.</p>

<p>The struggle was short. When Jimmy resisted
no longer, but, after a fall against the
fence with his arm doubled under and back,
did not try to rise, Billy came to his senses.
He cleared the dust from his eyes a little and
turned to see why Jimmy didn&#8217;t speak. He
lay with closed eyes, motionless!</p>

<p>A chill as from an ice field swept over Billy.
His heart seemed to fall down, down, as far
as his shoes. He noticed that things looked
darker, and his head felt light and queer. Another
fear assailed him; would he, too, collapse,
leave the little girls alone with the terror of two
senseless boys?</p>

<p>He roused himself sharply; found his handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and rubbed his eyes a little clearer;
bent swiftly over Jimmy, who stirred when
touched, and, to Billy&#8217;s intense relief, spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;ve broke my neck, kid,&#8221; he
said, feebly, as quaking Billy helped him to his
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jimmy, can you stand?&#8221;</p>

<p>He winced with pain, reeled, and would have
fallen but for the other&#8217;s sustaining hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here! Sit down on the bank.&#8221; Billy himself
was trembling so he felt it safer to see Jimmy
sitting. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get&mdash;Twinnies, run, run to
the tank and wet your handkerchief. Quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were at the dripping roadside tank and
back in a trice. Gently where a moment before
he had been ferocious with anger, Billy wiped
his play-mate&#8217;s face, or rather, changed the mud
from one spot to another, got him to his feet
again, and finally into the buggy with the little
girls by his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you drive?&#8221; he asked, anxiously, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
unhitched the horse. He noticed with a second
sinking feeling that Jimmy&#8217;s face twitched with
pain, that his right arm hung limp.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can&#8217;t Vilette can. Old Bob goes by
himself, anyway.&#8221; He made a brave though
unsuccessful effort to appear as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are&mdash;are you hurt bad, Jimmy?&#8221; came in
a quaking voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;No worse &#8217;n you, I reckon,&#8221; was the rueful
response. Billy&#8217;s appearance justified Jimmy&#8217;s
speech; for freckles were standing out large
and ghastly from one or two very white spots
on the younger boy&#8217;s battered face. &#8220;Can
you get home alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;go on quick! Here come folks!&#8221;</p>

<p>He watched the three drive away, the
brother holding the reins in his left hand;
the other he did not attempt to lift; and Billy&#8217;s
heart thumped faster as fear grew to a certainty.
He brushed himself weakly, turning
his back as a surrey-load of people passed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>&#8220;Had a fall, Billy?&#8221; Every one knew the
boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Brown,&#8221; he answered, keeping his
face from sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My clothes mostly,&#8221; he replied, hoping he
had told the truth, though a dreadful, big feeling
in his head, the humming in his ears, and
the pain in his eyes, made him guess he had
told a lie.</p>

<p>The travellers passed on; he righted his wheel
and began his slow, painful way home. It was
still cloudy and the welcome darkness setting
in early, shrouded him as he slipped down the
least public streets and alleys to his own side
gate. He put his wheel away, fed his chickens,&mdash;though
they had gone to roost,&mdash;went to the
cellar and brought meat and milk for dog and
cats, and reconnoitred the way to the Fo&#8217;castle.</p>

<p>Visitors! He saw them through the window.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Every step was growing more painful,&mdash;he
must get to his room. The space from the
woodshed roof to the tower room, before so
easily surmounted by a swinging jump, looked
now as high and far as Mount Whitney. Back
to the window he turned. The firelight was
dancing on the walls. Sister Edith was talking
gayly to neighbors who were standing near the
door, and May Nell was snuggled beside his
mother on the couch, the great yellow cat, or a
part of him, sprawling on her small lap.</p>

<p>How sweet and dear they all were! How
peaceful it looked in there,&mdash;too peaceful,
clean, for a dirty, fighting brute like himself.
What could he do? He shivered in the cold,
and the pain in his eyes increased. Would he
fall? Would they find him, have Doctor Carter,
learn the disgraceful truth? If the world had
looked dark that afternoon, it was now Egyptian
blackness.</p>

<p>There was a stir in the room. His mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
stood&mdash;May Nell, too&mdash;and the cat stretched
lazily on the couch. Sister Edith followed the
guests to the porch, as did his mother and the
little girl&mdash;the room was empty! He opened
the kitchen door, tried to hasten noiselessly,
yet thought he clattered like a threshing machine.
Into the living-room he crept, and lumbered
softly up the stairs that seemed a mile
long.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time Billy was at home,&#8221; he heard his
mother say as he opened her room door; and
he stumbled on more hurriedly, across the
bridge&mdash;at last, the Fo&#8217;castle!</p>

<p>He threw himself on the bed and wept the
bitterest tears he had ever shed in his life, tears
of shame. There he lay&mdash;hours, he thought&mdash;determined
to bear his pain and disgrace alone.
Yet it was only minutes when he heard his
mother in her room, coming!</p>

CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>ON STORMY SEAS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">BILLY did not lift his face from the pillow;
he was striving to steady throat and voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; she called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, mother! Mother, don&#8217;t come in
here! Don&#8217;t come in the same room with me,&mdash;I&#8217;m
not fit for&mdash; O mother, I&#8217;ve hurt
Jimmy for life!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett caught the despair in his words,
and knew this could be no ordinary trouble to
be petted away with a few caresses. Some
crisis had come that must be wisely met. She
entered, knelt by the bed, and put her arms
around him. The spring starlight dimly outlined
his head on the pillow but gave no hint
of its bruises. &#8220;Billy, dear, nothing you can
ever do will be bad enough to keep your mother
away from you. What is it, my son?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>The gentle words, the tender touch, the comfort
and hope in her words, unlocked his lips
and he told what he had thought to keep forever
untold.</p>

<p>He kept his hands from hers, and begged her
not to touch the handkerchief he had bound
around his head; but before his story was finished,
a growing stain on the pillow had oozed
into sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy! You said you weren&#8217;t hurt, but
you are!&#8221; Alarmed, she rose and switched on
the light, pulled off the bandage, and turned
faint at the wreck of the bright, clean boy
who had left her that afternoon. &#8220;My boy!
You&#8217;re dreadfully hurt! I must send for
Doctor Carter, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! Don&#8217;t, mother! I&#8217;ll run away!
I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221; He groaned and left his sentence
unfinished.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you may have broken bones&mdash;be
seriously injured.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>She took a step, but he caught her hand.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t care if I am, he mustn&#8217;t see&mdash;no one
must,&mdash;I didn&#8217;t mean you should. Besides,
I walked home and brought my wheel; I&#8217;ll live,
I guess,&mdash;I&#8217;m too mean to kill.&#8221; He put his
stiff, swollen hand over his face. &#8220;It&#8217;s Jimmy
that&#8217;s in danger.&#8221; A new note of terror came
into his voice as he remembered the pale face
and limp arm; he had never seen a fighting boy
look so before. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid Jimmy&#8217;s hurt inside,
mother. What if he should die?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett knew better than Billy how
much thumping a boy could live through; and
reassured him while she took off his soiled garments,
and started below for hot water and
remedies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell&mdash;must Edith and May Nell
know?&#8221; he called after her. &#8220;Oh, all the town
will&mdash;mother!&#8221; The anguish in his words
halted her. &#8220;Mother, this wasn&#8217;t a boys&#8217;
scrap at all. I didn&#8217;t think of you or&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
anything; an&#8217; something must have squelched
Betsey, she never peeped. Mother, I felt&mdash;I
felt mad enough to kill him!&#8221; He whispered
the awesome words.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t feel so now, my son. Jimmy
will soon be well; you, too. Then you can talk
with him about it. Rest, now; that is your
first duty,&#8221; she comforted, and left him.</p>

<p>Hot water, lotions, a mother&#8217;s tender hands,
best of all, a mother&#8217;s comprehending heart,&mdash;it
is wonderful what cures these can make. In
an hour Billy was comparatively at ease. His
sore body still ached, and his eyes &#8220;felt like
red fire on the Fourth,&#8221; he said; but the world
seemed less dark, and he was glad his mother
had not taken him at his word and left him to
bear his trouble alone.</p>

<p>Yet he could not long keep his mind from the
struggle. &#8220;Mother, won&#8217;t you find out soon
about Jimmy, how bad he&#8217;s hurt? An&#8217; I wish
I knew if Vilette &#8217;n Evelyn &#8217;re all right; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
looked awful to see &#8217;em hit with a horsewhip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get word from them in the morning.
Don&#8217;t worry any more, but rest; sleep if you
can. You can&#8217;t help them till you have helped
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still, since Billy had broken his resolution of
silence, he was feverishly eager to talk. His
thoughts were erratic, now in the present, again
flying back to the past. &#8220;O mother, you
should be lickin&#8217; me &#8217;nstead of petting me!&#8221;
he broke out passionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Billy? I don&#8217;t believe in whipping
unless all else fails.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, papa did. If he was alive he&#8217;d be
giving it to me about now, good and plenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you think he would have whipped
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember the first day I went
to school, he took me between his knees,&mdash;I
was a little kid then,&mdash;and said, &#8216;Billy, if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
know that you ever jump on a boy first to fight
him, I&#8217;ll lick you. And if another boy jumps
on you first, and you don&#8217;t fight back, no matter
how big he is, I&#8217;ll lick you then.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he didn&#8217;t say &#8216;lick,&#8217; Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he did. And he said, awfully solemn,
&#8216;Remember, Billy, no one but a coward strikes
his foe in the back. A boy of mine who could
do that,&mdash;I don&#8217;t think I should wish him to
wear this.&#8217; And he pointed to his Loyal Legion
button. O mother, I hit Jimmy first, I hit
him in the back, and I&mdash;I kicked him in the
stomach! I&#8217;ve disgraced papa&#8217;s button forever!&#8221;
His last words were a groan, and he
hid his face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett leaned over him without speaking
for a minute, but stroked his hair softly.
&#8220;Remember, with One there is no &#8216;forever.&#8217;
As long as we live we have a chance to retrieve.
Rest on that, my child. Now you must sleep.&#8221;
She kissed him and was silent, for a drop glistened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
on his cheek she knew he would not wish
her to notice.</p>

<p>She thought he should be in a warmer room,
but he begged so hard to stay that she yielded.
She put a bell near, that he might call her, and
went to him several times before she slept, finding
him somewhat restless, yet too profoundly
asleep to be wakened by her light touch. Outraged
nature was in charge now.</p>

<p>It must have been hours past midnight when
Billy&#8217;s chattering voice startled his mother.
She had heard no bell; the boy himself stood
by her bedside; she could see him dimly against
the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the matter,&mdash;I&#8217;m
drowned, I guess.&#8221; His teeth rattled, and the
hand he put out to her was icy cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy! You&#8217;re freezing!&#8221; She sprang up
and turned on the light.</p>

<p>He was a queer figure with his bandaged
head, one eye peering out, and a long, dripping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
red quilt trailing behind him. &#8220;I found the
bed flooded, and put the comfort round me; but
someway that&#8217;s wet, too.&#8221; He could hardly
speak for shivering.</p>

<p>She clapped him into her own warm bed, and
incredibly soon things were sizzling over the
alcohol lamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;The tank must have run over, Billy. You
forgot to shut it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t forget; the water was low,
and I left it running on purpose. But it&#8217;s
that west wind; she&#8217;s a hummer. She can
pump faster &#8217;n the old waste pipe can discharge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Friction and mustard, hot water bags without
and hot tea within soon set Billy&#8217;s teeth
at rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;How in the world did you ever sleep through
it, Billy?&#8221; his mother asked, coming in from
the tank-room where she had been to investigate.
&#8220;There is a small flood there. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
should think the first drop would have wakened
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It came to me feet foremost, I guess, and
soaked the quilt in instalments. I had a
tough dream, too; couldn&#8217;t wake up in the
middle. I dreamed I was on a ship in a bang-up
storm, and the vessel lunged like a bucking
horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can see that the wind, the shaking
tower, the creaking mill, would bring such
dreams,&#8221; his mother said. &#8220;Hear the wind
howl now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I thought all the crew were washed
overboard like chips,&#8221; he went on; &#8220;and I was
left alone. And she shipped water in mountains.
And I was cold as the North Pole. And
at last she foundered, and I went down with
her. And when I couldn&#8217;t choke any more
I woke up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little Billy! You&#8217;ve had a hard night
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>&#8220;Kinder rocky.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled wanly, and her heart ached for
him; but she knew sympathy was unsafe just
then. &#8220;If you could see that comical, crooked
eye of yours blinking at me, like a chicken asking
your intentions, you&#8217;d laugh, Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did laugh, yet was sober again. She was
tucking the clothes close about him, preparing
to lie down by his side. But he reached his
arms out suddenly and flung them around her
neck. &#8220;O mamma, the awfullest thing in the
world next to doing a crime, must be not to
have a mother. I must jolly May Nell more.
And, mamma&mdash;mother, I don&#8217;t know why,&mdash;&#8221;
his voice was very low and shy, &#8220;why God&#8217;s
looked out for me so good; but anyway,
you&#8217;re&mdash;you&#8217;re the whole bunch!&#8221;</p>

<p>She pressed him closer and kissed him. And
soon he slept.</p>

<p>But his mother watched out the night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>RED GOOSE FLESH</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE next morning Billy had a &#8220;temperature.&#8221;
His mother decided against school
for that day. At first he was glad. He didn&#8217;t
care if he had forty temperatures. He thought
almost anything in the way of fever was cooler
than he would feel if the boys&mdash;and the girls&mdash;should
see his face. Not that this was the first
time he had been scratched in a fight; before
he had not cared who knew. To-day it was
different,&mdash;there were things about this fight
he wished he could forget, even though he knew
Jimmy was not likely to die.</p>

<p>But a second idea came that made him fidget
about the room, lift his bandage and watch
the children on their way to school. His record
for attendance for the year had so far been perfect.
He knew that he owed it partly to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
mother&#8217;s tireless watch of the clock, and wondered
why he had not realized this before.
Now it was to be broken; she would be as sorry
as he could be; and it would have counted well
toward the prize. He tried to calculate how
many days he could be absent and still have
left some chance of it. The work was all reviewing,
he almost knew it, anyway. If he
only had his books,&mdash;but no, they wouldn&#8217;t
let him use his eyes.</p>

<p>A gentle rap halted his reflections, a sweet
voice asked to come in; and in a moment there
was a rose-leaf touch on his cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mamma said I was to ask no questions,
and I shall obey; but I do wish I knew how I
could help you.&#8221; She touched the bandage
that bound his head. &#8220;Does it hurt you
awfully much, Billy? I&#8217;m so sorry. My eyes
ache me, too, for looking at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was pleased with her sympathy; but
being a boy, he didn&#8217;t like to show it. &#8220;I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
tell you,&#8221; he said, eagerly, and without further
acknowledgment of her kindness, &#8220;ask Mr.
Brown to give you my books. Perhaps to-night
I can see to study.&#8221;</p>

<p>But not that night nor for days after did
Billy look at his books. The second morning
the fever was still present, and he told
his mother he was &#8220;all over red goose
flesh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Measles,&#8221; Mrs. Bennett pronounced; and
though it was a light case, and in a day or so
Billy felt as well as ever except his eyes, they
were sentenced to a dark room.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p0140-illus.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">May Nell plays teacher</p>

<p>May Nell had been &#8220;through the measles,&#8221;
yet she shared the quarantine. Billy resented
this at first. It was &#8220;no fair.&#8221; Afterward
he was grateful; for aside from the cheer of her
presence she did him a fine service. It was
her clever brain that proposed to read his lessons
aloud to him; and though he didn&#8217;t think
much of it at first, he soon saw that this would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
make a chance for the prize which in his heart
he had resigned.</p>



<p>She made a quaint picture curled in a big
chair under the window, where a lifted corner of
the curtain gave light to the book, but left the
rest of the room dark. It pleased her to play
teacher. She asked Billy numberless questions,
coaxed him to explain what she did not understand.
And he soon learned that one must know
a thing very well before he can tell it. He dictated
some of the written work, and she transcribed
it in her prim little script.</p>

<p>Yet Billy despaired when he thought of the
mathematics; Jimmy&mdash; With the thought of
Jimmy the hot blood rose to Billy&#8217;s cheek, and
he was glad the room was dark. It was Jimmy&#8217;s
right arm that was broken.</p>

<p>But May Nell&#8217;s ambition was boundless.
&#8220;We can do mathematics work, too. I can
multiply, and divide, and other things beside,
I can do; I&#8217;ll just be your paper and pencil.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>Billy was skeptical, yet soon convinced, as
the little girl slowly and carefully read the problems,
followed his directions, and obtained correct
results. A few problems were too complicated;
these the boy had her mark for attack
with recovered sight.</p>

<p>Yet only a part of the long day went to study.
They spent delightful hours rehearsing the
stories of favorite books, and otherwise amused
themselves by improvising tales of marvellous
adventure. The school children sent notes,
the latest school jokes, and original pictures,
interesting if sometimes not quite clear as to
meaning. Clarence indited his first letter.
Here it is:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p0142-illus.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The best of all was a letter from Jimmy,
scrawled with his left hand.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Billy</span>,&#8221; it read; &#8220;Shifty seen the fight.
He says it was something fierce. He says you
looked like a mad bull. He was hiding behind
the fence. He says he bet on me; but he was
glad he didn&#8217;t bet with nobody, because you
whipped. Shifty&#8217;s doing some of my written
work&mdash;I&#8217;m telling him how, of course. And
I&#8217;m studying right smart. Say, Bill, I don&#8217;t
lay no grudge. My arm&#8217;s getting on fine.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours truly,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy read the note several times. He knew
that Jimmy meant much more than the words
said; it was his offer of the &#8220;olive branch.&#8221;
And Billy, thinking over that miserable afternoon,
wondered again how it had been possible
for him to feel such murderous hate for anything
living. And for Jimmy! His mate at school,
in play! The picture came to him of Jackson
crying, of Vilette,&mdash;yes, it was not strange he
had been angry. But it was not his duty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
punish; even if it had been, he knew he had
forgotten Jackson and Vilette, forgotten everything
except the rage of the fight. Why was
it? Older heads than Billy&#8217;s have asked in
sorrow that same question after the madness
of some angry deed has passed to leave in its
wake sleepless remorse.</p>

<p>The best amusement of the hours of imprisonment
was planning for the performance
of &#8220;The Lady of the Lake.&#8221; Nothing definite,
except that it was to be out of doors,
had unfolded till now, when irksome leisure
and May Nell&#8217;s quick mind together bore
fruit.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can play the first canto, &#8216;The Chase,&#8217;
across the river in the Sunol Creek canyon,&#8221;
Billy explained, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there aren&#8217;t any deer,&#8221; the little girl
objected. &#8220;What will you do for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">&#8216;The antlered monarch of the waste</div>
<div class="verse">Sprang from his heathery couch in haste&#8217;?&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>&#8220;There &#8217;re deer up there, all right; but
of course we can&#8217;t get &#8217;em. We&#8217;ll have to
catch a jack rabbit beforehand and let him
loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Billy, the poor rabbit will surely be
caught; and you know the stag hid in &#8216;Trosach&#8217;s
wildest nook.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the kids&#8217;&mdash;boys&#8217; dogs are mostly old
or else too fat to run, like Bouncer. I guess the
rabbit can get away,&mdash;too soon, perhaps. We&#8217;ll
have you for Fair Ellen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; she must be Jean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t do it; she said so before. She
wants to be Alan-bane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the reason. She says a boy will
spoil the part; won&#8217;t get the shivers like she
will. She thinks a minstrel can&#8217;t&mdash;can&#8217;t minstrelize
properly without the shivers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s true,&#8221; May Nell replied, with
conviction. &#8220;And Queen will be Lady Margaret;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and you are Malcolm Graeme; and who
is Fitz-James?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty; and Charley will be Douglas, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Jimmy is already Roderick Dhu.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Roderick Dhu died from fighting Fitz-James;
I hate to give Jimmy a dying part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my conscience! That isn&#8217;t any matter.
All the grandest actors have the dying parts;
and they die gloriously; and the audience claps
and claps and claps; and the curtain goes
up, and they all come out alive again and bow
and smile; and you eat some candy and don&#8217;t
cry any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bul&mdash;dandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t like them to do that, Billy.
They ought to stay dead till the play is done.
When I see them smiling I feel as if&mdash;just
as I would if you made fun of me when I cried
for my mama,&mdash;it takes all the true out of the
play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as I get out of this,&#8221; Billy went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
after a short silence, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go over and fix up
Ellen&#8217;s Isle for you and Lady Margaret. We
can have</p>

<p class="center">&#8216;&mdash;a lodge of ample size,&#8217;</p>

<p>with</p>

<p class="center">&#8216;The lighter pine trees overhead,&#8217;</p>

<p>but not the strong log house where&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
hesitated, and May Nell quoted on glibly,</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;&#8216;The sturdy oak and ash unite&#8217;;</p>

<p>but I can</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent9">&#8216;twine,</div>
<div class="verse">The ivy and the Idean vine.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>If I only had an Idean vine; what is it, Billy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can search me.&#8221; Billy was about to
remark further, when a commotion arose among
the school children just passing on their way
home.</p>

<p>May Nell needed no second request to &#8220;catch
the racket and bring it in.&#8221; She flew downstairs,
and presently up again, arriving with a
breathless story. &#8220;O Billy, the circus train&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
wrecked! There won&#8217;t be any circus next week!
Some of the animals are all dead, and the fire
burned some&mdash; Oh, I can hear them scream
now, can&#8217;t you?&#8221; She put her hands over her
face and shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t feel so bad, Chick,&#8221; he comforted;
&#8220;it won&#8217;t bring them to life, and it hurts you.
That&#8217;s why you don&#8217;t grow faster; your feelings
eats up all your blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled faintly. &#8220;Then my feelings must
be bloodthirsty, Billy. How dreadful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the little kids take it hard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awfully hard, Billy. Some of them had
&#8216;grief swimming in their eyes.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little chaps! They&#8217;ve been talking
circus for a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy! I&#8217;ll tell you what let&#8217;s do; we&#8217;ll
make a circus ourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens to Betsey! We&#8217;ll do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Lady of the Lake&#8221; was that moment
deserted.</p>

CHAPTER X<br />

<small>SIR THOMAS KATZENSTEIN</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;BILLY, Flash is the cleverest cat ever!&#8221;
May Nell exclaimed as she bounded in
some days later.</p>

<p>The quarantine had been raised, and at night
Billy had &#8220;the run of the house&#8221;; though his
days were still spent in &#8220;the prison cell&#8221; as he
called the dark room. It seemed to him that
light came in with the little girl, and all the
sparkle and fragrance of the young summer
without.</p>

<p>&#8220;What new trick has Flash been up to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that bad, old, half-tailed Tom
that whips every cat in town but Geewhillikins
and Flash and Sir Thomas&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he&#8217;d lick him too, if Flash wasn&#8217;t
Tom&#8217;s body-guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, just listen! This morning your mama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
set out the meat for their breakfast. I had
Geewhillikins and Jerusalem Crickets in the
pound&mdash;the woodshed, you know. Oh, they
had a big breakfast before,&#8221; she added quickly,
feeling rather than seeing Billy&#8217;s disapproval.</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgive you,&#8221; he condoned.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a minute I heard the teentiest little mew.
I looked and there was Tom crouched against
the side of the house. He was shivering with
fright, and that old tramp cat was eating up his
breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The darned old robber!&#8221; Billy started
up and walked restlessly toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I took a stick of kindling from the kitchen
and crept out to chase the thief away; but just
then Flash trotted around the corner of the
house. He&#8217;s been on the front lawn all the
morning watching for gophers; wouldn&#8217;t come
when we called him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Flash; he always works for his
breakfast,&#8221; Billy pompously approved.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>&#8220;He ran up and touched noses with Tom
like a Feegee Islander,&mdash;are they the people
that touch noses for &#8216;How do you do?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so. What else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Flash mewed just once, very softly.
He couldn&#8217;t see the tramp cat, for the big oak
tree hid him. But the second Tom answered
his mew, Flash flew like a lightning streak,
around the tree and up to that old, stealing
feline cat. And he ran&mdash; O Billy, you&#8217;d
have laughed an ache in your side if you could
have seen him run,&mdash;over the fence, he ran
again, across the street, down the sidewalk,&mdash;he
never stopped till he came to the tip top of
Mr. Potter&#8217;s big locust tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By heck! Flash is all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he walked back as slowly and dignifiedly
as a minister,&mdash;isn&#8217;t &#8216;dignifiedly&#8217; an
awkward word? I wonder if it is right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind grammar, or spelling, whichever
it is; what did Flash do?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>&#8220;He went up to Tom&mdash;he was still crouching
against the house&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like the lazy coward he is,&#8221; Billy tartly
interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Billy, he&#8217;s so beautiful and so clever;
and he put his nose up to Flash <i>so</i> gratefully.
Flash just mewed again, low as before, and
walked off round the house. And Tom went
and ate his breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, old Tom&#8217;ll have to be cleverer than
I ever saw him to pay for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like Sir Thomas because he&#8217;s
a little indolent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s plain lazy. He won&#8217;t even wash
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet he has more mind than Flash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind? What do you mean by that? Anyway,
you can&#8217;t prove it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can, right now!&#8221; The little girl,
full of enthusiasm for her beloved yellow cat,
went over and laid her hand impressively on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Billy&#8217;s arm. &#8220;You know the dining-room window
screen hung from the top, that has the
broken catch on one side?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh huh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Tom jumps up from the outside, hangs
on the sill with one forefoot, and pulls out the
edge of the screen with the other till he gets
his nose in, when he can pry out the screen and
slip through easily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he can do that; I&#8217;ve seen him myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Flash can&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve watched, and called to him from the
inside; but he only stands and mews. Did
you ever see him climb up and open the screen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy could not remember that he had.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Billy, Tom opens it for him! He
climbs up, gets his nose in, and the largest part
of himself; then he crowds along as hard as he
can, and calls to Flash, &#8216;The way is clear;
come&#8217;;&mdash;you needn&#8217;t laugh; he says it just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
as plain as words,&#8221; she protested. &#8220;And Flash
springs up, creeps through, and jumps to the
floor, with Tom after him; and the screen slaps
to with a big noise. I&#8217;ve seen them do it three
times this week. Isn&#8217;t that a wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; Billy assented, heartily. &#8220;I take it
back about old Sir Thomas; I guess they&#8217;re
equal partners, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a regular Damon and Pythias,
aren&#8217;t they? And we&#8217;ll have Flash for the
Polar Bear, in the circus, and Tom for the
Royal Bengal Tiger, the baby tiger, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and we&#8217;ll have to train the dogs,&mdash; Whoopee!
Only four weeks of school. We&#8217;ll
have to hurry if we do the circus and &#8220;Lady
of the Lake&#8221; both before vacation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before vacation? Why, they&#8217;ll be just
the things to do <i>in</i> vacation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have to be done before vacation or
not at all,&#8221; he answered, so seriously that May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Nell wondered a little; wondered still more as
the moments passed and the dark room grew
very quiet. She did not know what purpose
was growing in Billy&#8217;s mind, a purpose that
largely concerned herself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>GOOD-NIGHT IN THE FO&#8217;CASTLE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE silence was broken a little later by
merry voices on the stairway. For several
nights the girls had been gathering in May Nell&#8217;s
room. Billy knew &#8220;things were doing&#8221; there
by the sounds; the tap, tap of the tack hammer,
added to much chatter and rustling. Now May
Nell caught him by the hand and pulled him
across the hall. A strange pungent fragrance
like burning spice, yet not familiar, met them at
the door. And inside, the dark hangings full of
lurking shadows gave the room a foreign air.</p>

<p>The Queen of Sheba in gypsy dress, and her
harum-scarum train buzzing with gossip and
exclamation, flocked in. Bess looked magnificent
in a mass of draperies that included
every Oriental thing to be found in several
families.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>&#8220;Jiminy whiz! Your royal splendor dazzles
me!&#8221; Billy chaffed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the Royal Egyptian Fortune Teller!&#8221;
Bess announced, in a deep voice. &#8220;This is my
desert tent. I shall reveal the past, present,
and future to those only whom my favor shall
designate. Slaves, the lamps!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence and Harry, much wrapped in white
about the head, but with bare little white arms
and bare little brown legs, came in solemnly
and placed some red lanterns on the table.
Bess posed in a chair decorated for the occasion,
arranged her draperies, pulled nearer the
&#8220;incense lamp,&#8221; which was her father&#8217;s Turkish
cigar lighter, laid out her cards, and bent
over them in grave silence.</p>

<p>Her absorption hypnotized the others to
wondering stillness. In a moment her attitude
and intensity had transported them to the mysterious
East, and put upon them the spell of
ancient superstitions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>At last she looked up and pointed a startling
finger at May Nell. &#8220;Mary Ellen Smith, my
familiars, who guard the portals of futurity,
declare that you shall be the first honored.
Minions, depart! Slaves, guard the door!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean and the twins, Charley, George and some
others, rattled down the stairs; while Clarence
and Harry stood rigid, with wooden scymitars
drawn, one on each side of the door.</p>

<p>Billy hesitated a minute. The dim room,
the wicked-looking red lights, Bess so stern
and mysterious,&mdash;this might frighten the little
girl. He ought to wait.</p>

<p>&#8220;Avaunt, hesitating noddy! The angel child
is quite safe!&#8221; Bess waved an arm, partly
bare and brown in spots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, go away, Billy; I&#8217;m not afraid.&#8221;
May Nell laughed happily. Her quick mind
was delighted with the masquerading.</p>

<p>Yet it was a very quiet little child that
crept down to the others a few minutes later;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
when asked of her fortune she burst into
tears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett came in and tried to learn the
trouble; but it was some time before May Nell
could be induced to tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;She said, the Queen of Sheba did, that I&#8217;d
be in danger, and some one would save me.
And I&#8217;d have a s&#8217;prise, and a hus&mdash;husband,
and fi-five c-chil&mdash; children!&#8221; She wailed
again and hid her face on Mrs. Bennett&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Golly! There&#8217;s nothing skewgee about that
fortune,&#8221; Billy commented, encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; yes, there is, Billy.&#8221; May Nell
lifted a teary face. &#8220;Five children! If it had
been two, or perhaps I could possibly bring up
three; but f-five, o-o-oh!&#8221; she wailed again,
heedless of the laughter around her.</p>

<p>Several others were summoned and returned
with remarkable reports. At last two high-pitched
little voices called in concert down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
stair: &#8220;The Royal Seeress will rend the veil of
futurity for William Bennett.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s you, papa,&#8221; Clarence piped, as an
anxious post warning.</p>

<p>Artful Bess! Billy had treated it all as a
huge joke; but now May Nell&#8217;s depression, the
unfamiliar sound of his right name, the dim
room with its shadows and half-suffocating
odors,&mdash;all conspired to send a sober Billy into
the circle of lurid light that came from the
two lamps gleaming on either side of dark Bess
like angry eyes.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the entire Egyptian
fortune-telling outfit came down stairs at
Billy&#8217;s heels. The hubbub was a riot of fun,
and no one noticed that Billy said nothing about
the revelations of destiny made to him; though
later Jean recalled that in the zig-zag journey
around the park that was Billy&#8217;s evening exercise,
he spoke very little to the chatterers with
him, even forgot to &#8220;jolly.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>That night when Mrs. Bennett went into the
Fo&#8217;castle there was an unusual note in Billy&#8217;s
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop and chin with me just a little, won&#8217;t
you, marmsey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s the &#8216;chinning&#8217; to be about?&#8221;
she questioned, sitting on the bedside; &#8220;the
fortune?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy looked at her wonderingly for an instant.
&#8220;You guess everything that troubles
a fellow, don&#8217;t you? How do you do it?&#8221; He
sighed deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it as bad as that?&#8221; She smiled, and
smoothed back the thick, tumbled hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse! She said soon I&#8217;d have to be very
brave&mdash;that ain&#8217;t bad&mdash;but I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to be&mdash;to
be a minister&mdash;a preacher!&#8221; The last
word came with a woe-begone vehemence that
made his mother laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you think that&#8217;s so dreadful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O mother,&#8221; he began, excitedly, and stopped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Only lately had he called her &#8220;mother&#8221; in his
serious moments, and the name gave her pain
as well as pleasure, for it was one more announcement
of the coming man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;I know I must
freeze to some sort of business, and that mighty
soon, too. But a preacher&mdash;why, he can&#8217;t be
like anybody. He never has any fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think fun the first business of the
world?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; he sighed; &#8220;I suppose duty is the
first business; but duty is such a narrow,
knock-you-down little word.&#8221; His voice was
tense and hard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett continued her gentle, even
strokes; bent and kissed him softly before
replying. &#8220;Duty looks narrow only when it
opposes inclination, my child. Selfish people
hate duty; but those who live the longest and
best lives could tell you that every victory duty
wins brings an ever-increasing joy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>&#8220;O mother, how can there be joy if life is
all work and never any fun?&#8221; He took her
hand and pressed it against his cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a little secret about work; with
grown-ups it is often their play; and they like
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you <i>like</i> to work?&#8221; His tone was insistent;
and he lifted his head and looked hard
at her, as if to challenge the tiniest bit of insincerity
that might be lurking back of the
words. &#8220;<i>Like</i> to work?&#8221; he repeated with
added emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, I don&#8217;t think you could possibly have
been happier on your birthday than I was; yet
I was so tired that night that I could not sleep.
The work of that day was play to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy threw both arms around her and hugged
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there are many times when the duty
itself is disagreeable, yet doing it brings a finer
joy than shirking it ever could bring.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll be a&mdash;a preacher if I ought to.
But gee! it&#8217;s rocky!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Billy,&#8221; his mother laughed, &#8220;you need
not decide to-night. Besides, it was all Bess&#8217;s
nonsense. I can&#8217;t quite imagine my heedless
boy in a pulpit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy thought he detected a touch of resigned
disappointment in her words, and looked up
with a sudden wonder widening his eyes, making
them shine even in the dim light of the
shaded lamp. &#8220;Do you want me to preach,
mamma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not unless you wish to so much that you
will not do anything else, Billy. The world
needs preachers of the right kind sadly; and
the right kind take up the calling reverently,
though they know it will bring them small
worldly return and much toil.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy was very still for a little, but burst
out presently: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to work, mother;
as soon as school closes I&#8217;ll start.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>He felt his mother start. &#8220;You&#8217;re too young
for hard work, Billy; you do enough as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, when you and sister turn gray getting
it out of me. No, I&#8217;m going to do real work
that will earn money; and I&#8217;m going to take
this never-get-enough grub-basket of mine to
a table where my own hands have earned the
grub.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy! My&mdash;boy!&#8221; Mrs. Bennett bent
over him; and he felt a tear where her cheek
touched his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feel that muscle,&#8221; he said a moment later;
bending his arm, and pressing her fingers to it.
&#8220;That&#8217;s got to grow by a broom or hoe, something
besides football!&#8221;</p>

<p>His words had a new ring, and his mother
was wise enough to respect the young independence
in them. &#8220;What brought you to
this decision, Billy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember that story about a man who
died for love of a girl because he knew he ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
not to marry her? I thought that sort kind
of noble, but you said there was nobler. Do
you remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I can&#8217;t recall what I said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said, &#8216;Death is easy. It is much braver
to live without the love one craves, to do one&#8217;s
duty each day, and smile as the world goes by.
That&#8217;s the finest love I know,&#8217; you said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t understand it then. Now I do.
My own sister is that bravest of lovers.&#8221; His
words rang with pride as well as love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Billy, what has happened to make you
think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night I heard something on the Q. T.
I didn&#8217;t mean to, but I&#8217;m glad I did. I was
in the pantry chuckin&#8217; some bread an&#8217; butter
under my solar plexus when I heard Mr. Wright
tell sister in the sitting-room&mdash;I guess some
door was open a crack&mdash;that his law business
was growing a little. I didn&#8217;t hear the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
words, but there was &#8216;please&#8217; in italics in his
voice. But sister said, an&#8217; I heard her plain
enough, &#8216;No, Hal, not till I&#8217;ve saved enough
to take Billy through school.&#8217; &#8216;I&#8217;ll help&mdash;&#8217;
Mr. Wright got as far as that when this guy
waked up,&mdash;knew he&#8217;d snuck information not
intended for him. So I made a noise; I
scatted the cat&mdash;no cat there&mdash;slammed the
door, and kicked up a racket generally so&#8217;s
they&#8217;d know I was there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett smiled. She thought they could
have had no trouble in locating Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I went in an&#8217; spoke to &#8217;em &#8217;s though
I hadn&#8217;t heard a word, and hustled off to bed.
I thought &#8217;most all night, and decided that sister
shan&#8217;t wait a day longer for me to grow up.
I&#8217;m going to hustle for myself, so she can get
married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, my little, little boy!&#8221; She lifted the
tousled head and pressed her cheek close
against his.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to work as soon &#8217;s school&#8217;s out;
it&#8217;s for you and May Nell, too, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your school, my child! You must be
educated; you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, marmsey; but there&#8217;s night shops
where a fellow can gobble education by the
hunk, you know, and&mdash;&#8221; He paused. Even
his own mother didn&#8217;t know the pang in his
heart when he thought of Jean and Jimmy, and
the others, going on together through the high
school, perhaps the university.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett rose and tucked him in snugly.
&#8220;Let us drop it till school closes, Billy. Then
we&#8217;ll talk it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All but finding the job, mother. Jobs
don&#8217;t hunt boys; and mine&#8217;s going to be waiting
for me when the school house door shuts:
that is, if I can persuade any man in the town
or county that he needs a boy my size.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett bade him good-night, and left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
him to the stars and the quiet night. Her heart
was still sore for the little boy of the past, yet
a strange joy came to her; the thoughtful,
observant, earnest man had heralded his coming.
She should be very proud of him.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE CIRCUS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE day was fine. Billy, not long released
from his green shade, wondered if the
world was ever so lovely before; the flowers so
sweet, the birds so joyous. Could it be only
a few short weeks since that gray Sunday?
Billy&#8217;s confinement had quickened him, introduced
him to himself; now he looked on life
with wider eyes, with a more understanding
heart.</p>

<p>He was out early wheeling from house to
house, where various parts of the &#8220;show&#8221; were
receiving last touches. One by one he gathered
each &#8220;attraction,&#8221; and herded them all to
Jimmy&#8217;s big barn, where the procession was to
form. Some were late, Bess for one; but Billy
was not anxious about her.</p>

<p>It had been hard to persuade her, though her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
heart was aching to join the fun. &#8220;Huh!
Do you suppose I&#8217;d be a common snake-charmer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Common?&#8221; Billy retorted, &#8220;they can&#8217;t be
common. They have to have power more&#8217;n
anybody. And snake charmers &#8217;most always
are Egyptian Princesses, or royalty of some
kind,&#8221; he added hastily, lest exact Bess should
call on him for a genealogy of his princesses.</p>

<p>The magic name won the day. Bess was
ever dreaming of the land of mystery, whose
pictured daughters of old she resembled; and
the chance to masquerade in its atmosphere
lured her.</p>

<p>Max was the first to be quite ready with his
exhibit. It was a queer creature that one gradually
discovered to be some sort of a bird;
though such a one had never before been seen
on land or sea. Max had arrayed his mother&#8217;s
big white gander for the occasion. A turkey-tail
fan made a huge breastplate, if one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
imagine a breastplate of feathers. All the long-tailed
roosters that had been killed in town for
months, one would guess, had contributed to the
coat of sprawling feathers that was tied over
the body of the bird. And no one knew by what
magic the boy had coaxed some one to lend him
the magnificent peacock plumes that rose high
above the little wiggling goose tail.</p>

<p>In a cage of wire netting bearing the legend,
&#8220;The Roc&mdash;The Egg,&#8221; the uncomfortable
gander swayed and craned his neck; and all
but his voice was satisfactory. In the bottom
of the cage a whitewashed stone the size of a
small pumpkin did duty as the egg.</p>

<p>A three-legged rooster appeared. And Sir
Thomas Katzenstein, according to schedule,
roamed his box in great agitation, though in
fine form, impressively carrying out the label
on his cage, &#8220;Baby Royal Bengal Tiger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lying in silent disdain on his familiar cushion,
Flash, as the &#8220;Polar Bear,&#8221; did equally well;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
while Bouncer fretted between the fills of the
home-made, bunting-draped chariot that served
as &#8220;The Polar Bear&#8217;s Snowy Lair of the North.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a half-grown calf with an artificial
hump for the &#8220;Water Buffalo&#8221;; and Harry and
Clarence were cunningly strapped together for
the Siamese Twins.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they are dead,&#8221; Jimmy protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;But couldn&#8217;t another pair have been born
in Siam?&#8221; May Nell questioned; and as no
one felt sufficiently informed to deny it, Harry
and Clarence continued their strained relations.</p>

<p>The Prettymans&#8217; white cow was ingeniously
shaped and caparisoned to represent &#8220;India&#8217;s
Sacred White Elephant&#8221;; and Jackson was the
Hindoo leader. This exhibit caused much controversy.
The attendant should ride on the
neck of the elephant, all agreed to that; but
the cow objected; so they compromised by
having Jackson walk. The matter of costume
for Jackson was not so easily settled, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
differing pictures of sacred elephants presented
a variation in the attendants&#8217; garb. May Nell,&mdash;who
was to be the &#8220;Fair Princess of Bombay,&#8221;&mdash;as
soon as she could get a hearing,
ended the dispute amicably by suggesting that
Jackson be allowed his choice in the matter of
dress, an alternative that permitted each disputant
to withdraw from the argument with
honor.</p>

<p>Jimmy had the trick ponies and the trained
dogs. Teaching them was the chief joy of his
life. What if there were only two ponies, and
their spots were painted on? And what if the
children had seen all the tricks over and over
again? They were good as new each time.
Besides, the ponies&#8217; one brand-new trick, when
at the crack of a whip they stood on their hind
feet in unison, was so effective that it frightened
May Nell. She saw it first in the barn; and
when their shod hoofs came down she thought
they would crash right through the floor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>Jean was the Goddess of Liberty; Shifty
and another larger boy the steeds that pulled
her car. But boys and box wagon were so
smothered in bunting that only the Goddess
was conspicuous, standing, well-balanced, stately,
and fair.</p>

<p>One tall, ambitious girl contributed a unique
float called, &#8220;Lot&#8217;s Wife Looking Backward.&#8221;
She had not been certain of the color for the
desert, consequently had made the whole thing,
including the wagon, the boys, and herself snowy
white. She had copied an old Bible picture,
carrying out the idea with sheets, and such
liberal doses of flour, that only a heavy dew was
needed to turn the float to dough instead of
salt. However, the sun shone, and the addition
of diamond dust over all made a very realistic
picture that Billy praised heartily.</p>

<p>Guinea pigs, pigeons, and other and larger
live stock, normal or otherwise, masqueraded
as marvellous creatures from foreign lands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>Bess arrived at last. A gorgeous affair was
her chariot, the foundation being Mr. Prettyman&#8217;s
spring wagon. Bess, with some borrowings,
Charley&#8217;s help, and her own quick
invention, had made a very good imitation of
a circus wagon. Charley, the Strong Man, held
the reins over old Dom Pedro, the horse she
loved, that had once been a racer. She had discovered
some very real looking, jointed snakes
that wriggled and curved in a manner startlingly
serpentine; while tremendous boa constrictors,
cut from old circus posters, were disposed about
the cage in alarmingly lifelike positions.</p>

<p>Bess&#8217;s coming launched the procession. People
in the vicinity who had not before known
of the presence of a circus, knew it now. Everybody
talked at once, and every living thing
made its own kind of a noise. Billy as Master
of Ceremonies had his hands full, his voice full
too, one might say.</p>

<p>But at last they got under way and proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
as quietly as possible down the back
street to the home of Mrs. Lancaster, where
Buzz, as the &#8220;Prize Baby of Vine County,&#8221;
awaited them in his car, which was very handsome,&mdash;one
would never have dreamed it was
only a large wash-tub strapped to a coaster;
flowers and cloth do make such wonderful
changes if handled with art!</p>

<p>That preliminary march was not without
adventure. The &#8220;howdah&#8221; on the White
Elephant where May Nell rode as the Fair
Princess of Bombay, became loose and threatened
to spill its small bit of royalty. And when
Harold cinched the thing tighter the old cow
bellowed so the smaller children broke and ran.
However, they were soon back, and the procession
halted at Mrs. Lancaster&#8217;s front gate
in fair order. But when she saw the imposing
string of wagons, children, and animals, known
and unknown, she was afraid to trust her precious
Buzz to them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>&#8220;Billy Boy, it&#8217;s fine! It&#8217;s splendid! But
it&#8217;s so big I&#8217;m afraid Buzz will be scared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you go along, Mrs. Lancaster?
Don&#8217;t prize babies have attendants?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely; but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please, Mrs. Lancaster,&#8221; Billy coaxed.
&#8220;The circus won&#8217;t be any circus at all without
Buzz. We&#8217;re to have him for a side show
after the performance. We&#8217;ve advertised <i>him</i>,&#8221;
Billy pleaded well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the lack of Buzz shall not damage
your show; I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; Mrs. Lancaster yielded.</p>

<p>And Billy did not think of it as strange till
Buzz&#8217;s grandmother called from behind the
window curtain, &#8220;Delia, you surely won&#8217;t
traipse through town with that crowd! How
you will look!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, ma, the children are quite respectable;
I know all their mothers.&#8221; Buzz&#8217;s mamma
looked a little mischievous.</p>

<p>&#8220;You romp!&#8221; came the disgusted voice once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
more. &#8220;You&#8217;d better cut your hair, and your
skirts, and be a child again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to, Billy,&#8221; Mrs. Lancaster whispered;
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never liked being grown up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy beamed upon her. He adored her, as
did every child in town.</p>

<p>Now the band came up, a troop of boys in
gorgeous uniforms made of red calico and tinsel
paper. A drum and fife kept tolerable time;
but the wheezy harmonicas and paper-covered
combs, the tin horns and clanging triangles,
quite &#8220;covered&#8221; any tune the fife attempted.
Yet what matter? It was a joyful noise;
and even the horses kept step to the valiant
drum.</p>

<p>Flags waved. In spite of Billy all shouted
orders at once. The line was as serpentine as
Bess&#8217;s snakes that she held high and wriggling
above her snake-entwined head. Oh, she was
a very realistic snake charmer! Buzz crowed
and clapped his pudgy little hands; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Lancasters&#8217; small Chinese boy who pulled the
baby&#8217;s car almost fell over himself laughing.</p>

<p>Before they turned into Main Street, however,
the procession was in fair alignment, and the
solemnity of the moment hushed all chatter.
Billy&#8217;s most personal disappointment was
Bouncer, who, unhappy because he could not
caper in freedom at Billy&#8217;s heels, let his lovely,
bushy tail, that usually waved above his back
in a graceful curve, hang limp and dusty between
his legs; while from drooping head and
sad eyes, he looked reproachfully at Billy every
time the latter ran past.</p>

<p>But on the whole Billy was proud. &#8220;The
kids showed their pluck and stuck to their jobs,&#8221;
he told his mother afterward. The White
Elephant bellowed impressively in front of the
postoffice; and Jimmy&#8217;s ponies never reared so
gracefully as in front of the bank.</p>

<p>All the people came out of their shops and
offices and clapped generously. A light breeze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
floated out the flags, and made the gold fringe
on the Snake Charmer&#8217;s cage wave and look
rich and foreign. The band outdid itself; and
as the forward end of the procession turned out
of the street, a great cheer began behind them,
grew and swelled, till even the youngest child
knew &#8220;folks liked the circus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the park!&#8221; Billy shouted, his heart
thumping with joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The children will get too tired,&#8221; the Snake
Charmer warned.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we won&#8217;t!&#8221; came a dozen voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; take us to the park, papa,&#8221;
piped one half of the Siamese Twins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they won&#8217;t be too tired! The
kids have pluck.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Snake Charmer was silenced; for if the
children had before this been tired, not one of
them now but swelled with pride and fortitude
at this praise from Billy.</p>

<p>All went well for some blocks. There was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
flattering audience at each front door; a few
honored the pageant by following. These were
mostly mothers of the younger children, who
knew the possibilities of such an aggregation
of animals and boys.</p>

<p>But just before they were to enter the park
Bouncer had his innings. A rabbit, startled,
sprang from under the roadside bushes and ran
down the street toward the open country.
Bouncer&#8217;s tail went up. He dashed out of
line, overturned the Polar Bear&#8217;s cage, and was
off after his quarry, barking wildly, with the
fast disrupting cage dangling at his heels.
The Polar Bear, liberated, flew home like a
streak of white light. The trained dogs broke
from their struggling boy leaders, carrying with
them gleaming bits of red paper uniform.</p>

<p>The two steeds attached to the car of the
Goddess of Liberty, also deserted their task,
and marked their path with bright bits of paper
and bunting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>Old Dom Pedro, scenting fresh excitement,
snorted and bolted. The Strong Man was not
strong enough to hold him to line, though he
guided the horse safely to the Carter stable,
where Bess appeared suddenly, swaying alarmingly
in her flimsy snake cage.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Charley went back to the
disappointed remnants of the show gathered
in Jimmy&#8217;s barn, and told them Mrs. Carter
had said, &#8220;no more circus this day for Bess.&#8221;
Buzz and his laughing Chinese had been hurried
to safety. The Roc had shed a part of his
false feathers, and was fast giving himself away
as plain gander. The White Elephant had also
become restive, and it was thought best to
transfer the Fair Princess of Bombay from her
howdah to <i>terra firma</i>. And the Goddess of
Liberty, minus her car, and a part of her draperies,
and plus a big smooch on her cheek, was
somehow not very imposing. Various other
livestock became weary or rebellious, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Siamese Twins had to be severed to prevent
their coming to blows.</p>

<p>It was too bad! There could be no show in
the barn. But the band was still lusty, the
trick ponies remained, the boys and girls were
eager to talk it over, and&mdash;the procession had
been a success!</p>

<p>Presently the little Chinese boy returned,
his grin resumed, and a large basket on his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Missee Lancastler, she say you heap good
show. Now you heap hungly. You catchee
him plenty glub.&#8221; With that he uncovered a
treat that made them forget the circus. They
munched the sandwiches, the luscious fruit,
candy, and cake, and other good things from
Mrs. Lancaster&#8217;s generous pantry, and discussed
the procession; voted Mrs. Lancaster a trump;
and decided to have a circus every year.</p>

<p>And the shouts that greeted this fiat shook
the old barn and made the hens in the hay
cackle with fright.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>THE HIDDEN HUT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE last week of school arrived. It was
almost as good as a holiday, for those who
had made the required percentage during the
year were excused from examinations, and
after roll call, released from attendance; and
these included Billy and most of his cronies.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett spoke frequently of the change
in Billy. He was growing more thoughtful,
observant. He remembered small duties, noticed
if mother or sister looked tired or ill, and
volunteered help where formerly he would not
have known help was needed. Perhaps none of
them knew, least of all May Nell herself, how
lastingly her example of watchful kindness had
impressed itself on Billy&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>If he was more thoughtful, quiet, at home,
his hours of play were more keenly enjoyed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
they grew daily fewer. He had found a &#8220;dandy
job&#8221; that would not take him away from home;
he could still mow the lawn, and do the chores.
He was glad now that he had learned various
parts of the housework, for he was to be janitor
and messenger at one of the banks, a fact to be
told his mother as a surprise on the last day of
school.</p>

<p>He went home after the engagement, walking
on air and talking aloud to himself. &#8220;Gee!
I don&#8217;t suppose there&#8217;s a squinch-eyed ghost
of a chance for me to win that prize money;
but twenty-five a month&#8217;ll pay mamma for
what I eat,&mdash;and break, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy didn&#8217;t see Doctor Carter passing in his
buggy, nor hear his greeting; neither did he
see the understanding smile; the Doctor easily
guessed that Billy was planning fun. And he
was; this last week of school should be the
happiest ever. Didn&#8217;t work begin next Monday?
Real work! He couldn&#8217;t catch up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
bankers in his arms, like his mother, and cajole
them into favors. No; it would be all day and
every day for a hundred years! Only Sundays,
and they didn&#8217;t count; for wouldn&#8217;t he have
to go to church just the same? Mother and
sister would be hurt if he &#8220;put out to the woods&#8221;
Sunday mornings. And the bank people, too,
would expect him to go to church; hadn&#8217;t
they said none but steady, well-behaved people
could remain in their employ?</p>

<p>&#8220;Jiminy whiz! This is my very last week of
boy; next week I&#8217;ll have to be a man,&#8221; he said
gloomily.</p>

<p>He was soon at the &#8220;lodge of ample size&#8221;
made the week before, not of &#8220;strong logs&#8221;
but of old fence-rails and willow twigs. He
wondered if the girls would be able to imagine
it a &#8220;lodge,&#8221; or if May Nell and Jean, who
were to come a little later, could fix it according
to the poem.</p>

<p>He decided to go first on the mountain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
set his traps for rabbits; also to mark the bounds
for the &#8220;chase,&#8221; so that they could gather on
time at the island and go on with the second
canto. If they didn&#8217;t &#8220;do&#8221; two cantos a day
they wouldn&#8217;t finish; for Friday must be given
to school. As it was some of them had to be
at the school house each day at three to rehearse
for the &#8220;last day&#8221; exercises.</p>

<p>Billy hid his wheel in the same tangle of rose
vine, now all pink and fragrant with bloom,
that had sheltered it that earlier Spring afternoon,&mdash;was
it years ago? It seemed so. As
he crept out of the brush and turned to the
steep tangled mountain, he saw the haunted
house, with the bare space in front. There
were the two brothers fighting fiercely!</p>

<p>Billy slipped quickly to cover again where he
could watch unseen. The men&#8217;s faces were
black with passion, and their low, intense words
seemed all the more deadly because strange,
foreign. A coat split down the back with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
ripping report, and the boy saw the flash of a
knife, and turned away feeling sick.</p>

<p>Was there to be another murder? Ought he
to call? If he did wouldn&#8217;t they turn on him&mdash;kill
him? No matter. Some one might be
on the road and hear. And he could run pretty
fast. Anyway he must risk it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Murder! Murder!&#8221; he shouted with all
his strength; and his boy&#8217;s voice reached far
up and down the lonely distances.</p>

<p>He saw the men stop, draw apart, and look
around. They discovered no one, but delayed
their quarrel and hurried in the direction of
the sound, exchanging short angry speeches as
they ran.</p>

<p>With a boy&#8217;s cunning and swiftness Billy
made a running creep through the underbrush
up the steep mountain side. From a peephole
higher up he stopped, breathless, and
watched them beat the chaparral round about
where he had stood; saw them go down into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the road, look each way, turn and scan the
mountain; and at last slink off, one to the house,
the other to the vineyard.</p>

<p>Relieved, yet with his nerves quivering Billy
plunged into the deep woods of the higher altitudes.
The air was unusually hot and stifling,
and his eyes watered. &#8220;Fire in the woods
somewhere,&#8221; he murmured, recognizing the
odor of smoke.</p>

<p>He had left his traps,&mdash;the fight had sent
all else flying out of his mind. No matter.
He could set them in some vineyard. Already
the short grass on the hills was brown, and
many of the wild flowers were past their blooming.
The rabbits would be seeking the tender
green of the vines, the purpling alfalfa, standing
lush and sweet, ready for mowing.</p>

<p>Up, up Billy climbed. On the bare spaces,
or balanced on the point of some slender rock,
he stopped frequently to look down on the
beautiful valley below; on little farms laid out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
checker-board fashion, dark green squares for
orchards, lighter green for vineyards, with
tree-lined lanes running between. Overhead
fleecy clouds chased one another like freshly
washed, woolly sheep across the blue pasture
of the heavens. In the north the great blue
mountain loomed, all its opalescent tints and
shadows hidden till the setting of the sun should
light them forth.</p>

<p>Billy breathed deep. How he loved this
opulent valley which was his birthplace and
home! He longed to see all the world, yet
he thought no other place could be as beautiful.</p>

<p>As he crashed again through the close-grown
brush he almost forgot the ugly scene just
enacted below. He had been sorry to leave
Bouncer to come with the girls; now he was
glad. It was good to be quite alone up there
with Nature in her less familiar places. A dark
ravine lured him. Well as he knew the mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
he had never explored this gorge. The
delicate fragrance of wild azaleas greeted him;
he could see their pale pink bloom tipping the
tall trees that rose out of the chaparral forty
or fifty feet above the stream that tinkled beneath
them.</p>

<p>As he climbed down, reaching from branch
to branch, very cautiously, he knew not why,
he was suddenly halted by the sound of low
voices. Carefully he crept nearer. A tiny
hut came in view, with an open door, and the
glint of fire within. A man was standing outside,
smoking a pipe, yet wearing hat, coat,
and gloves, as if about to set off. He was very
large. His clothes were new and showy, too
bright in color, too large of check. His watch
chain was massive; the big diamond out of
place with his colored shirt; and the soft silk
handkerchief he drew from his pocket was a
brilliant red, and the largest Billy had ever seen.
Another man, in the doorway, was smaller and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
bareheaded. His sleeves were rolled up, and
his hands were stained.</p>

<p>Billy heard the hatted one say &#8220;So long!&#8221;
saw him start down a path that followed close
beside the stream, perfectly hidden from any
one who might be walking the crests above.
The other man brought a pail and started up
the hill.</p>

<p>Billy knew that the man was going to the
spring for water; knew where it was hidden,
far in the woods, big and round, deep and clear!
It was more than a hundred yards away at least.
He waited and listened till the noise of snapping
twigs was hushed, then crept down and peered
into the hut. The place was so small there was
no need of entering; he could see all the interior
from the sill.</p>

<p>What he saw there lent wings to his feet.</p>

<p>He climbed cat-like to the crest again, slid
through the brush, dashed across bare spots,
jumped from rocks that jutted in his way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
struck stones but righted himself before falling,
truly &#8220;hit only the high places,&#8221; as he breathlessly
told the girls waiting for him at Ellen&#8217;s
Isle.</p>

<p>&#8220;No &#8216;chase&#8217; to-day, girls. I&#8217;ve got business
in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, chuck the business,&#8221; Jean said impatiently.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t it wait till noon? I must
go home then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it can&#8217;t wait one minute longer&#8217;n it&#8217;ll
take me to get to town. Maybe I can come
back though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to break the record if you get
here before noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, let me plan,&#8221; May Nell interposed.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll work hard to fix up the Lodge before
Jean has to go home. I&#8217;ll stay and wait for
you, and Bouncer with me; and I&#8217;ll search for
my Idean vine. I must have something that
will do for that. I wish I could find a real
one.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>&#8220;I hate to have you stay without Jean,&#8221;
Billy objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the harm? She&#8217;s on Mr. Potter&#8217;s
land, and the road&#8217;s near.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Bouncer&#8217;s here,&#8221; May Nell added,
hugging the dog affectionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;m off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t told us what hurries you
so,&#8221; Jean called, while Billy was already sprinting
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t stop. It&#8217;s private anyway.&#8221; He
waved his hand, ran across the foot-bridge and
down the road, dodged into the brush for his
wheel; and in a moment they heard his shout
as he sped by toward town.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE girls worked hard to bower the interior
of the Lodge with evergreen; to
spread and hang the rugs they had brought;
but before their task was finished distant
whistles warned Jean. She took Bouncer&#8217;s
face between her hands and charged him with
May Nell&#8217;s protection as if he were human.
And Bouncer wagged his tail, and in a short,
sharp bark pledged himself as if he were human.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go off Mr. Potter&#8217;s land, will you,
May Nell? The fenced part, I mean. Eat
some lunch soon; Billy may be gone an hour
longer. Good-bye. Don&#8217;t get too tired. I&#8217;ll
send Clarence if I can find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jean, too, crossed the little bridge, climbed
the fence, mounted her wheel, and rolled off
down the dusty road.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>May Nell watched the flying figure turn out
of sight around the mountain; and for a minute
the forest grew absolutely still, and the child
began to tremble. But a meadow lark, almost
from under her feet it seemed, sent forth a rippling
song; across the river her mate replied.
A flock of white ducks came waddling and
quacking from the opposite field, plunged into
the water, and swam about noisily, tipping their
little tails up and their big bills down as they
reached for submerged morsels. Bouncer made
a swift circuit of the Lodge, sniffing now and
then questioningly; but came soon and sat down
in front of May Nell; put his paw on her knee
and gave her another short bark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good dog! I understand you, Bouncer,
and I&#8217;m not lonesome any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened the lunch pail and gave him a
scrap from it; ate a sandwich herself; and in a
moment started off to find the Idean vine.
Nothing appeared that fitted her mind&#8217;s picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of that creeper; but she found a great sheet of
delicate wild clematis, covering the tangled roots
of a fallen oak with its pale green tendrils.
The earth was soft, the roots easily lifted; and
shortly she had masses of it uprooted and trailing
after her to the Lodge.</p>

<p>Many times she had seen Mrs. Bennett transplant
the garden flowers, had helped; now she
put all her lore to use. Patiently she toiled with
brittle sticks and pointed stones till the vine
was replanted against the rude walls; emptied
the dinner pail and trudged back and forth to
the river several times for water, to wet the
earth above the roots; and patted it down with
muddy little hands.</p>

<p>She was happy and the time passed unnoticed
till she had finished, and put the food back in
the pail, when a queer, dizzy feeling came upon
her and she sank down on one of the rugs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t Billy come?&#8221; she asked
of Bouncer; and the dog ran out of the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and stood on three legs, one forefoot lifted, his
eyes fixed on the spot where Billy had disappeared.
But no master was to be seen, and he
went back to May Nell, whined, and put his
nose on her knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;My stomach&#8217;s crying so I&#8217;ll have to eat
one more sandwich, Bouncer. It&#8217;s a shame
when Billy isn&#8217;t here. I&#8217;ll give you half, old
dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put out her hand for the pail but stopped
suddenly, for the dog growled; and the next
instant the room darkened, and a man stood
in the doorway.</p>

<p>May Nell looked at him with wide eyes. She
saw that he was not a vineyard workman, his
clothes were too fine. She did not see them in
detail, the large checked trousers, the shiny
gloves, and the big diamond, but she felt instinctively
that one who could dress so was
different from the men she knew. And the
look in his face made her cold.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>&#8220;Well, Miss Smith, are you alone here?&#8221;</p>

<p>How did he know her name, she wondered,
yet answered more bravely than she felt.
&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; She thought it best to be as polite
as possible. &#8220;I&#8217;m alone now, but the boys
are expected every minute.&#8221; She would say
&#8220;boys&#8221; even if Clarence didn&#8217;t come; it
sounded more protecting.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re George Rideout Smith&#8217;s kid, ain&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p0200-illus.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;You&#8217;re George Rideout Smith&#8217;s kid, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but I&#8217;m afraid my papa&#8217;s dead, he&#8217;s
been gone so long.&#8221; How she hated that word
&#8220;kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he ain&#8217;t dead; he&#8217;s alive and bully,
with a wad that bulges. I&#8217;m going to take
you to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right&mdash;now&mdash;are you?&#8221; The arm that
was around Bouncer tightened, and she thought
her &#8220;heart would fly right up into her throat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, right now.&#8221; He stepped nearer, and
Bouncer growled and bristled.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>The man swore and looked for a cudgel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please, mister, sir, don&#8217;t hurt Bouncer.
I&#8217;d rather you&#8217;d hit me. He&#8217;s the best dog
ever lived, and I won&#8217;t let you hurt him.&#8221;
Her courage grew as she spoke, and he stopped
his search and glanced her way. She looked
up, bravely pleading for the dog she hugged
harder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a plucky kid, all right,&#8221; he replied,
touched more than he would have admitted.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t hurt the dog if you do as I tell you.&#8221;
He looked for a cord or rope, but found none,
and pulled from his pocket a red handkerchief.
&#8220;Tie this around his neck; let one end hang
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child obeyed, but her fingers trembled;
and Bouncer whined and licked her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull it tighter.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was not difficult, for the soft silk slipped
into a knot as strong as if tied in hemp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring him here.&#8221; The man stepped out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and laid his hand on a sapling that grew beside
the Lodge. May Nell followed with the dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now hold his head between your hands and
tell him not to touch me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child was &#8220;boiling inside,&#8221; yet she believed
Bouncer&#8217;s life depended on her obedience.
And anyway, Billy would come in a minute.
Oh, why wasn&#8217;t he there now!</p>

<p>The big hands in spite of the shiny gloves
tied the dog fast and very close to the tree.
&#8220;Now give me that dinky ribbon from your
hair,&#8221; he commanded, and tied the growling
dog&#8217;s forefeet together. And May Nell knew
the man&#8217;s voice was gruffer when Bouncer was
helpless. He gazed at her reproachfully from
eyes that moved though his head could not.
She would never forget those sad eyes that
followed her when she was ordered away.</p>

<p>She glanced down the road, and swiftly
around. Not a soul in sight. Obedience was
inevitable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>He held out his hand, but the little girl put
hers behind her. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come by myself,&#8221; she
said with dignity. Whatever happened that
dreadful man should not touch her.</p>

<p>He laughed coarsely. &#8220;George Smith&#8217;s kid,
all right. You&#8217;ve got the same high way with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going to take me?&#8221; she asked,
trying to equal his long stride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you&#8217;ll be safe till I let your father
know I&#8217;ve got you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you said you would take me to him.
I thought you knew where he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he laughed, and patted May Nell
roughly but not unkindly. &#8220;I do; but there&#8217;s
preliminaries before I get you two together.
<i>Sabe?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>May Nell didn&#8217;t understand, but thought it
best to answer in the affirmative. Beyond
that she said nothing, but trudged along by
his side till they came to the road and turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
toward the haunted house, when he took her
suddenly in his arms and walked on in the
deepest of the dusty ruts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can walk,&#8221; she said, struggling to be put
down.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you can, but I&#8217;ll carry you just the
same.&#8221; His smothering hold warned her to
quiescence; and she did not stir till he set her
within the rear door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you live here?&#8221; she questioned with an
irrepressible shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but I stop here sometimes. Are you
afraid of ghosts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; there aren&#8217;t any. Billy says so,
and he knows. He knows, too, that there are
other people here beside the Italians.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man faced her abruptly. &#8220;The devil
he knows!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he?&#8221; May Nell stared innocently
into the darkening eyes. &#8220;I should think that
would make you awfully agitated.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>For an instant he looked as if he would beat
her. Then his face broke into a smile that held
no fear for her. &#8220;Say, kid, you&#8217;re up to the
limit; and I&#8217;m on the square with you. In
three days, if you obey me, you&#8217;ll jump into
your dad&#8217;s arms. I&#8217;ve got to lock you up now;
but nothing&#8217;s going to hurt you, and I&#8217;ll see
that you&#8217;re comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Locked up! The child&#8217;s heart beat stiflingly;
yet she did not cry out; she thought self-control
would win her more favor than tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t so bad,&#8221; he continued, as he led
her into a sunny upper chamber that looked
on the mountain in the rear. &#8220;And it&#8217;ll be
all over in a day or so; you&#8217;ll see your father,&mdash;on
the square you will, little kid. Do you
think you&#8217;ll scream? You&#8217;d better not.&#8221; He
put his hand under her chin to lift her face,
and she was glad he wore gloves.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not make a noise, and I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll try
not to cry; but I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll ha-have t-to,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
she faltered, struggling to hide her eyes that
grew moist in spite of herself.</p>

<p>Again he patted her shoulder, and this time
his voice was more kind. &#8220;You&#8217;re a brave
little girl, and if I was your dad I&#8217;d be dead
stuck on you. Just you don&#8217;t be afraid. I&#8217;ll
bring your supper by and by.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went out. May Nell stared after him,
dazed and trembling. When the key turned
in the lock she looked around wildly; ran to
the window and tried it. It was nailed down.
For a second she stood quite still, gazing
straight before her. Then the horror of her
plight swept over her; she threw herself on the
bed, a crumpled little heap, buried her face in
the pillow, and sobbed piteously.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>AGAINST THE FIRE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">DOCTOR CARTER was not in when Billy
arrived at his office breathless and hatless.
He had not foreseen this. All the way
to town his thoughts had raced with his wheel.
He had planned how he could tell his story the
quickest; had thought of no other ear for his
confidence than Doctor Carter&#8217;s, the kind, all-understanding
physician who had fought valiantly
if losingly to save Billy&#8217;s father; who
had ever since been the most thoughtful of
friends as well as the best of physicians. He
seemed to Billy the only man to trust with his
secret. This was something that could not be
told to the best mother in the world, even not
considering the fright it would give her; it was
quite out of a woman&#8217;s world.</p>

<p>The boy went into the street again, mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and rode rapidly round the corner. His own
home was across the way; his mother might
see him at the office and call him. But once
out of sight he stopped to consider what came
next. Who was the right man to tell after the
Doctor? The Sheriff!</p>

<p>A shiver chased up and down Billy&#8217;s spine.
He knew the Sheriff by sight only; and he was
so inseparable from the handcuffs the boy had
seen protruding from a pocket, that Billy felt
it would &#8220;almost fasten suspicion on a fellow
just to be seen speaking to the officer.&#8221;</p>

<p>But a familiar sound came to his ear, and he
turned to see the Doctor&#8217;s splendid bays pounding
down the street, pulling the buggy almost
by the taut reins. Billy followed quickly and
was soon closeted with the man, who listened,
first with a smile, afterward with grave attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy, you have done a wonderful thing!&#8221;
he said when Billy had finished. &#8220;You must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
come with me and tell your story again. If it
comes out as I think, you&#8217;ll earn at least a
thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half paralyzed with astonishment Billy went
with the Doctor to the Sheriff&#8217;s office; but he
was out and the deputy didn&#8217;t know when he
would return; thought it might be within an
hour or so. There was nothing to do but wait.
Billy&#8217;s perplexed, baffled face touched the
Doctor. His temples were already gray, but
he had not forgotten how a boy feels.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to see your mother now,
do you, boy? No more do you feel like jabbering
with Bess at our table. Come over to the
hotel, and we&#8217;ll lunch together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mrs. Carter&#8217;ll expect&mdash;&#8221; Billy began,
yet stopped, for the physician was laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;A doctor&#8217;s wife gets over &#8216;expecting&#8217; very
young, Billy. They won&#8217;t think I&#8217;m dead if I
don&#8217;t come home to lunch. But your mother?&#8221;
His inflection finished the question.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be all right. May Nell and me&mdash;I&mdash;we
took our lunch and went over to Potter&#8217;s
pasture. Shoot! She&#8217;s waiting now! I hope
the poor little kiddie&mdash;little girl&mdash;eats, don&#8217;t
wait for me,&mdash;she an&#8217; Bouncer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;ll eat when she gets hungry, never
fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Billy thought with pride that May Nell
was one person he knew better than the
Doctor.</p>

<p>They turned into the town&#8217;s finest hotel, just
opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t&mdash;I haven&#8217;t washed. I&#8217;m&mdash;&#8221;
All at once as Billy walked through the tiled
entrance, and felt himself in the midst of
splendors he had viewed only from without, he
was overcome with the suspicion that he looked
rather queer beside the immaculate Doctor.
He knew his hair &#8220;stood up all ways for Sunday&#8221;;
and his face must be dirty. &#8220;But they
won&#8217;t know how dirty,&#8221; he reflected; &#8220;this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the time them plaguey freckles&#8217;ll get in an&#8217;
hide the dust.&#8221; Freckles were Billy&#8217;s sorest
point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me, Billy; I must wash up.
I&#8217;ve had a dusty drive up Spring Mountain;
you know the roads aren&#8217;t watered up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy looked the Doctor over and wondered.
He was not subtle enough to suspect the Doctor&#8217;s
purpose. &#8220;Golly! I&#8217;d hate to have to
wash as much as a doctor,&#8221; he exclaimed, as
they stepped into the exquisitely appointed
lavatory. &#8220;You look now like you&#8217;d just had
a Turkish bath. But I&#8217;m glad of the chance
for myself.&#8221; He surely did look better when
the two came out and crossed to the big dining-room;
though there was a tell-tale streak around
his neck, and his crown lock stood stiff and
divided.</p>

<p>At first he could not eat with relish, his mind
was so distracted with admiration of the magnificent
room, and impatient to get his worrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
secret off his heart and conscience. But his
wise host ordered so artfully, and filled the intervals
of waiting with such delightful stories
and anecdotes, explanations of the decorations,
funny facts or conjectures concerning the hotel
and guests, that before he knew it, Billy had,
he told his mother afterward, referring to his
stomach, &#8220;loaded her up to the guards, &#8217;nough
to make you &#8217;shamed of me, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they entered the Sheriff&#8217;s office again
it was two o&#8217;clock. He was there, and gave
Billy a private audience far more graciously
than he would have done had not Doctor Carter&#8217;s
presence been voucher for the importance
of the matter. When the boy repeated his
story, less confidently, less dramatically than
before, yet not needing the Doctor&#8217;s comment
to prove its value, the Sheriff drew a long breath
and emphasized it with a blow of his fist on the
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the gang we&#8217;ve been hunting through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
five counties. Boy, you&#8217;ve done what the
State&#8217;s been trying a long time to do. The
reward&#8217;s a good lump; if we bag the game you
shall have your share.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy looked on wide-eyed, as the Doctor said
with a puzzling smile, &#8220;And, Sheriff, if I don&#8217;t
think you divide fair with my friend here,
you&#8217;ve got me to deal with next election.
See?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Doc,&#8221; the other replied a bit
gruffly; &#8220;suppose we catch &#8217;em before we fight
about the divvy.&#8221;</p>

<p>It took a very short time to gather the posse,
instruct it, and set out for the mountain. The
Sheriff gave Billy an old hat and bade him to a
seat behind the swift horses; and Billy obeyed,
feeling a strange elation as they set out. It
was just like a story. Could it be he, plain
Billy Bennett, that was assisting the State
to find long-sought-for criminals? The horses
flew, yet Billy thought they would never arrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
at the turn in the road where they would leave
them. He felt as if in some unknown way the
man at the hut would surely know of their
coming, would hide, destroy, perhaps carry off
all that would convict him, and the other, the
big man,&mdash; Oh, would they never be there?</p>

<p>But a different and sudden fear leaped in
both hearts as they rounded the shoulder of
the mountain. The air had rapidly grown more
oppressive; now they knew the cause, the
forest was on fire!</p>

<p>June had been unusually warm and dry, and
careless early campers had already started their
annual conflagrations. Now high over the
crest of the mountain the flames came sweeping
down; came with the wind from the valley on
the other side where they had raged till fuel was
exhausted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott, boy! We&#8217;ll have to hurry.
We must get up there before the fire gets down.
Do you know the shortest way?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Billy answered breathlessly as he
leaped from the buggy; &#8220;but we&#8217;ll have to go
in the way I did if you want to catch &#8217;em sure.
We can come out by the trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>They tied the horses, and once hidden from
the road, shed every superfluous garment.
Billy was quite ashamed of the chill he could
not help when he saw the handcuffs, pistols,
and cartridges disposed neatly and conveniently
about the Sheriff&#8217;s waist. They looked
so vicious, &#8220;disrespectable.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heat and smoke increased alarmingly as
they went on, the man puffing at the boy&#8217;s
pace. In and out, occasionally doubling and
returning but never losing altitude, Billy crashed
on. His slender body slipped through underbrush
by way of small apertures that would not
admit the man&#8217;s greater bulk; he had to break
his way. The boy, also accustomed to running,
climbing, had the advantage of better
breath; though the other could not, Billy still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
held his mouth shut against the suffocating
smoke, kept his smarting eyes partly closed.</p>

<p>The roar of the flames came dreadfully near.
Trees cracked, crashed and fell, sending up
columns of sparks and cinders that dropped
about the panting climbers. Billy began to
wonder if he would hold out to the end of his
task. His boy&#8217;s agility had easily outdone the
man&#8217;s; but he had made the trip once before
that day, had ridden from town at a killing
speed; and now his endurance was almost at
an end, while the Sheriff was getting his
&#8220;second wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>They came to the crest of the gorge. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
have to slow up and zig-zag down carefully
or they&#8217;ll hear us an&#8217; get away,&#8221; Billy suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t be watching for visitors,&#8221; the
man answered; &#8220;they&#8217;ll be hiding the plant
and skinning out of here,&mdash;if they haven&#8217;t
already,&#8221; he added apprehensively. He stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
back to the wind and scanned the opposite
bank. &#8220;There they are, two of our fellows;
the chaps haven&#8217;t escaped in that direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>As ordered two of the posse were closing in
from the west toward the rendezvous. A few
more steps and the four met. Those who had
been ordered to beat the mountain about the
spring were waiting below; the fire had perfectly
policed that territory.</p>

<p>As the four descended the air in the gorge
became clearer. They approached the hut
stealthily; and when in full view of the closed
door, the Sheriff told Billy his part of the work
was done, and ordered him home out of the
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Sheriff, you won&#8217;t send me off
now, will you, when the business is just beginning?&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of the grave situation, the officer
smiled at Billy&#8217;s entreating words, remembered
suddenly the danger from both fire and possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
lurking desperadoes. &#8220;All right. Get behind
that tree, and stay out of the reach of
stray shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three men lined up in front of the closed
door, and one of the deputies quickly threw it
open. For an instant the officers stood motionless
with weapons drawn. Billy watched with
fascinated eyes; the moment the door opened
forgot orders, ran and crouched behind the
Sheriff, peering under his uplifted arm. There
in the lurid firelight that streamed through the
closed window, stood the two men he had seen
before, hands up, rigid, staring into pistol
barrels. Floor boards were torn up; strange
vessels, scales, various paraphernalia Billy could
not understand, lay about them; while in a
deep hole they had dug, a small, iron-bound
chest was partially covered with earth. The
men&#8217;s faces were smutched, streaming with
perspiration, and pale with terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just in time, I reckon,&#8221; the Sheriff said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
facetiously; &#8220;pull up that chest and come along
to our party.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fight gleamed in the big man&#8217;s eye, and for
the breath of an instant he hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come! We can&#8217;t be cremated while
we wait. Mush!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Sheriff was a small man with fair, curly
hair like a girl&#8217;s; but there was that in his eye
that reinforced his pistol, made the big fellow
quail, the other mutter a low warning. The
two lifted the chest by its strong handles and
stepped out.</p>

<p>In the short moments that had passed since
their coming the Sheriff saw that the fire had
gained perilously. Instead of sparks great
flaming brands dropped all around them; the
crests of the ravine were sheets of fire that
swept downward, wrapping every tree and shrub
in their path, making of the pines huge towers
of flame.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a better way,&#8221; Billy called, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
deputy leading started to climb back as he had
come. &#8220;Follow the creek; there&#8217;s a trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good news. Run ahead, boy, and
show us the way. Fly, fly!&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy needed no hurrying. He dashed off
along a well defined path, free from hindering
branches. It hugged the brawling stream,
crossed it more than once by way of stepping
stones, and led on past the already shriveling
azaleas. It must have been long used to be so
clear.</p>

<p>Billy ducked his head into the cooling water,
filled his mouth, and ran on. He could hear
the painful breathing of the prisoners bearing
the chest. It looked heavy, and he knew it was
hard to carry, walking single file down the steep
trail. How awfully they must feel, Billy
thought. It was like the children in the fiery
furnace. Did the men see that this was a tragic
beginning of the just penalty for their sins?
Cheats! Robbers! No, not robbers, boldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
risking life for booty, but cunning thieves,
stealing from their fellow men, from widows,
orphans, perhaps from his own mother; she
had taken a counterfeit piece only a little while
before.</p>

<p>The heat was awful; yet it was growing less,
for the fire was nearly spent, but Billy was so
exhausted he did not perceive it. He began to
stumble, to see double. Everything seemed to
be on fire,&mdash;trees, rocks, even the water gleaming
from overhead flames. His blood felt hot
in his veins; and long afterward he saw red in
his sleep. At length his foot caught in a root,
and he fell heavily.</p>

<p>They came upon him a second later, insensible,
his head bleeding from a scalp wound.
Hurriedly the Sheriff lifted him close to the
brook, dashed water over his face, washed out
the cut a little, and bound it with his handkerchief,
not untenderly if in haste; for Billy had
won something more than his approval.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t wait for me,&#8221; Billy exclaimed,
opening his eyes suddenly; &#8220;you won&#8217;t catch
&#8217;em! The fire&#8217;ll get there first! Hurry! Leave
me alone, I tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Sheriff smiled at the note of command
in the boy&#8217;s incoherence. &#8220;Not on your life,
sonny,&#8221; and his voice softened; &#8220;we&#8217;ve got
to have you in our business. Help him along,&#8221;
he said to one of the deputies, as they came a
moment later to where the path broadened;
while he walked behind covering the panting
prisoners.</p>

<p>Presently they came to others of the posse,
and after that to a long line of farmers and other
citizens, fighting desperately but successfully
against the dying flames.</p>

<p>The clearer air revived Billy, and he was soon
walking without help, coming shortly to the
road where the wagons waited; coming in sight
of Ellen&#8217;s Isle.</p>

<p>May Nell! Where was she? He had forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
her! It must be three&mdash;four&mdash; Oh, how
late was it? Was she safe? Or had she fainted
from fright; and was she lying there now, helpless?
He looked across the plashing river to the
green, blossoming isle, grateful for water and
grass and green shrub, and the sheltering Lodge
that would keep her safe from the fire. Yet
the terror of being there alone, of seeing that
awful sheet of flame sweep down the mountain
to her very feet,&mdash;perhaps a fainting spell,&mdash;that
surely must have followed,&mdash;with no one
there to revive her, it might be&mdash;fatal!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Betsey, give it to me!&#8221; he whispered in
agony of soul. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let up&#8217;s long&#8217;s I live!
Maybe I&#8217;ve killed her!&#8221;</p>

<p>But even as he looked he saw two people
coming; his mother and Jean, crossing the foot-bridge
that led to the pasture side of the river.
The throbbing in his head, the stifled lungs,
interest in the capture of the prisoners,&mdash;all
faded before this terrible dread.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>&#8220;Let me go, please!&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a little girl, our refugee, over there, fainted, I
think, perhaps&mdash;dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Sheriff wondered at the boy&#8217;s vehemence,
yet was too busy loading the wagon to pay
much attention to him. &#8220;Think you&#8217;re fit,
sonny? You look all in. Better ride to town&mdash;we&#8217;ll
send some one for the little girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no! I&#8217;m fit&mdash;I must find her myself&mdash;right
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man gave him an affectionate slap. &#8220;Go,
then. You&#8217;re a right game kid, sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy was off, fear lending fleetness to feet
that a moment before had been leaden. He
overtook his mother and Jean in the path to
the Lodge. &#8220;Have you come for her?&#8221; he
panted. &#8220;Do you think she&#8217;s alone still?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened to you, Billy?&#8221; his
mother questioned sharply as she turned at his
voice and saw his damaged head. &#8220;You&#8217;re
hurt, Billy!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>&#8220;Not a bit!&#8221; His words were strangely
impatient. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to find her!&#8221; He
started past them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, Billy! You <i>are</i> hurt, badly. Let
me see.&#8221; She put out a detaining hand.</p>

<p>But he was not to be hindered. &#8220;It&#8217;s only
a scratch, mother; you can fuss it up all you
want to later; but you mustn&#8217;t stop me now!&#8221;
He pulled away from her and bounded up the
path.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my fault, too, Mrs. Bennett; don&#8217;t
put the blame all on Billy,&#8221; Jean half sobbed;
and hurried after him.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Bennett wasn&#8217;t blaming any one;
she didn&#8217;t really know what the excitement was
all about.</p>

<p>Before he emerged from the leafy path Billy
heard well-known whining, and wondered why
the dog didn&#8217;t come to meet him. The next
instant he saw him straining against his bonds.</p>

<p>Bouncer tied? That red handkerchief! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
boy went cold and pale. Before he looked he
knew that May Nell was not there. He turned
his white face to the others as they came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been stolen, mother! But I&#8217;ll find
her&mdash;I know where to look. Don&#8217;t be afraid,
mother, I <i>will</i> find her!&#8221; he repeated with grave
emphasis, as he whipped out his knife and cut
the dog loose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy! Who could steal our little girl?
I cannot think it. She&#8217;s gone with some of the
children to watch the fire.&#8221; Mrs. Bennett&#8217;s
words were braver than her face, for in her heart
she felt Billy was right, though she wondered
why.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve stolen her, all right. I don&#8217;t know
why, but I know who,&mdash;it&#8217;s the Ha&#8217;nt people!&#8221;
Billy panted, coming out of the Lodge.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Billy!&#8221; Jean gasped, fear for the little,
delicate girl in that eery place lending sympathy
to her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure, my boy? I&#8217;ll go with you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>&#8220;No, no, mother! This is business for only
Bouncer and me.&#8221; He caught up the cut handkerchief
and called the dog before his mother
could hinder. &#8220;Find her, Bouncer! Find May
Nell! Sic &#8217;em!&#8221; he shouted, and set off heedless
of his mother&#8217;s continued protestations,
after the bounding dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can send some one after us, a man&mdash;not
you, not either of you,&#8221; he called back over his
shoulder, and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>Jean was for following in spite of Billy&#8217;s
commands; but Mrs. Bennett, full of apprehension,
insisted that the girl should go with
her; and the two set out in search of help.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE BRIDGE TO SAFETY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">NEITHER boy nor dog paused till they came
to the dusty road. There Bouncer stopped
and ran excitedly about the spot where the
big man had taken May Nell in his arms;
doubled back on his track, stopped again, and
looked up at Billy, perplexity written all over
his face. Billy encouraged him with word and
caress; but he came at last, put his nose against
Billy&#8217;s knee, and whined apologetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Bouncer. I&#8217;ve another card
up my sleeve!&#8221; He patted and hugged the old
dog till his tail waved once more gracefully over
his back. &#8220;Here! Try this. Sic &#8217;em!&#8221; Billy
thrust the scraps of red silk under his nose; and
in an instant Bouncer was off after the new
scent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it!&#8221; Billy panted feverishly. &#8220;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Ha&#8217;nt!&#8221; Heedless of the dog running with
his nose close to the ground, Billy rushed on.
His shirt was torn, his trousers hanging by one
suspender, his shoes cut and one tap turned
back. Ashes whitened his hair; though at the
back a dark mat was still damp from oozing
blood,&mdash;the handkerchief that had bound it
had been torn off by a twitching twig. His
smarting eyes watered so that he could hardly
see his way. Yet of all this he was unconscious.
Weariness, pain, his cracked and
bleeding lips,&mdash;he knew nothing of them, felt
nothing.</p>

<p>It was as if some tremendous force had taken
possession of his tired, stricken body, and carried
it on with no volition of his own. Afterward
he remembered, understood; knew it was
his own will that rose and ruled every bodily
faculty; knew, and was glad, for that day he
stepped into a realm of power he should never
lose as long as he lived.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>In front of the stone steps that led up to the
barred door he hesitated; but the dog raced
round to the rear. Instantly Billy followed.</p>

<p>What if the Italians should be there? Impossible.
Surely they would be on the mountain
fighting fire. What if the door should be
locked? The thought made him tremble, yet
he hurried on and softly tried the handle.
It would not open!</p>

<p>Baffled, yet knowing he had expected it, he
ran this way and that, peering round each
corner, scanning the bare, high walls to see if
by chance some window had been left unbarred.
Not one less than a dozen feet from the ground!
He ran back to the door, was almost tempted
to shake it, yet knew that would be a foolish
trick; some one might be within guarding May
Nell; might at the first noise still more securely
hide her,&mdash;they said there were fearfully deep
and dark cellars under that house! She might
come to&mdash;to some dreadful harm!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>In desperation he stood still, gazing at the
windows above; reprimanding the dog sharply
when he whined, though his fingers unconsciously
patted away the sting of the rebuke.</p>

<p>The solid rock of the mountain had been cut
away from the rear of the house to form a natural,
paved court. At the top was a small
chicken coop, its wall flush with the wall of
rock; and near it grew an oak sapling not
larger than Billy&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>It quickly occurred to him to run around
and climb up there by the coop. Perhaps he
could see into the windows&mdash;perhaps see&mdash; He
didn&#8217;t wait to finish his thought, but
scrambled frantically up the steep and came
around to the top of the wall. The window
opposite and level with him was bare but not
as dirty as the others; and against it he saw
a bed-post. Anyway that room was used
by some one besides ghosts, he thought; and
wondered what to do next. Just then Bouncer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
sprang up and gave a single short bark, his
bark of greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s there, old dog!&#8221; Billy caught Bouncer&#8217;s
nose tight in his hand to prevent a repetition;
and at that instant May Nell herself
appeared at the window!</p>

<p>It took two hands to hold the dog&#8217;s mouth
shut now; and for a minute that Billy thought
much longer, it seemed as if he never would be
able to make him keep quiet. But he succeeded
at last, and turned again to see May Nell
standing in full view with her finger on her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you hurt?&#8221; Billy spelled with the hand
alphabet every boy and girl knows.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; well,&#8221; came the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the house; in this room, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the brothers, hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any one else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>&#8220;Open window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. Nailed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Break it,&mdash;not now; when I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! They&#8217;ll kill us!&#8221;</p>

<p>From where he stood Billy could see the distress
in her face. He must think of a way to
get her, and he must, <i>must</i> hurry!</p>

<p>He ran back a few steps and found a loose
board he had climbed over when coming up.
This he carried to the edge of the wall. &#8220;When
I call,&#8221; he spelled out, &#8220;break window, use
chair, come across on board.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>Just then he saw a wagon in the distance
rounding the curve of the mountain. This was
his minute. He must get her before that team
passed. Then if any one attempted to prevent
him he would have help. He turned back to
May Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must do it,&#8221; he spelled. His stiffened
fingers must have carried authority, for she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
nodded; and he saw her get a chair and stand
with it, ready to do his bidding.</p>

<p>He lifted the board, trying its weight. Could
he ever get it safely placed? Higher he lifted
it, and began to let it drop; but he saw that
if the other end missed the window sill, it would
pull him down to the court below. Frantic,
he stared about for help, for inspiration. He
dared not wait till the passers came in hearing;
the sound of his voice calling might too soon
rouse men inside, make them shoot perhaps.
As it was he expected every minute to see a
swarthy face appear, a hand with a knife or
pistol. It was not for himself he feared, but
for May Nell, the little girl who for some strange
reason was worth something to these desperadoes,
and whose life would be on his soul if he
did not save her.</p>

<p>His boyish knowledge and imagination, equal
to many pictures of danger for the girl, did not
extend to her captors. He never stopped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
consider, nor would he have understood if he
had, the plight of the criminals. He knew that
two had been captured, one of whom before
that had carried off May Nell; but his small
newspaper reading of &#8220;gangs&#8221; of counterfeiters
had given him visions of dozens of
desperate criminals, terrorizing communities,
and equal to any bold crime. Now in his
mind&#8217;s eye he could see men skulking in the
brush, listening in rooms below, only waiting
to pounce on May Nell the moment she
smashed the window. Oh, yes, he must hurry&mdash;hurry!</p>

<p>In his distress his wandering eye discovered
a bunch of vine ties, short pieces of soft hemp
rope for fastening vines to their supporting
stakes. They were hanging against the rear
of the coop, and a gust of wind had blown them
into view. Like a flash he sprang and caught
them; tied several together in quick, strong
knots, and lashed himself to the little tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Then he took up the board again, poised it at a
perpendicular, calculated the angle, and slowly
dropped it. Would the end reach the sill?
No, it was too short!</p>

<p>He tried to hold it from falling, but could not.
It seemed as if his arms would be pulled out of
their sockets. It would fall short&mdash;he must
hold on to it, not let it strike below, for the
noise would betray them too soon; and&mdash;the
men in the wagon were passing!</p>

<p>With a supreme effort he straightened his
arms just as the board reached the level of the
sill, pushed it forward with all his might; and&mdash;it
caught! Caught by an inch or less!</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; his upheld warning hand said to
May Nell. He found his knife, cut his lashings,
and beckoned to her vehemently. He
waited only for the crash of glass and sash, when
he threw himself outstretched on the ground,
and pushed the board hard against the lower
edge of the window frame.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p0236-illus.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">She scudded across the bending board</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s up to you now, my girl,&#8221; he panted
under his breath. &#8220;The board will bend&mdash;you
mustn&#8217;t be frightened. Fix your eyes on
the tree&mdash;come fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gee! It was a scaly trick for a little girl,
he thought; and felt sick. Would the plank
bend too much? Slip? She was such a little
thing&mdash;if only she could be a truly fairy for a
minute!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, God, walk with her!&#8221; he prayed silently
when he felt her weight first touch the board;
prayed as he never had before. It seemed as if
something strange and strong was going out of
him right to May Nell.</p>

<p>Yet almost before the prayer was breathed
the child with incredible swiftness scudded
across the bending board and stood safe by his
side!</p>

<p>He sprang up, caught her hand, and raced
with her down the rocky steep, calling wildly
to the men in the wagon as he ran. Bouncer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
no longer watched, vented his pent-up excitement
in noisy yelps; and above the din
Billy heard loud angry words in a foreign tongue
that he knew were execrations, commands to
return.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that his voice made no sound;
that May Nell never ran so slowly; that the
travellers would surely not hear him, not stop.
How could they hear in all the noise?</p>

<p>Yet they had already stopped, turned, and
driven quickly to the house, hurried by the
frenzy in the boy&#8217;s tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take her in,&#8221; Billy gasped. &#8220;They stole
her; they&#8217;re after&mdash;save her&mdash;hurry&mdash;&#8221;
He could say no more, but suddenly collapsed
and sank to the ground; and the last sight he
remembered was the dark Italian at the house
corner, talking fast, with one hand in a sling,
the other waving a knife threateningly.</p>

<p>Yes, Billy had fainted for the first time in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
life. The two men, heedless of the Italian, took
the boy up gently. One sat in the bed of the
wagon and held Billy as easily as possible, while
the other lifted May Nell to the seat, mounted
beside her, and drove rapidly back to town.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>BILLY TO-DAY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THINGS happened very fast the next few
days. &#8220;Something doing every minute,&#8221;
Billy put it. Billy had neither been ill nor injured,&mdash;only
exhausted. The wound on his
scalp had been worse in appearance than in
fact; and a couple of long nights in sleep, and
easy days at home mended him completely.</p>

<p>Was not May Nell safe? Almost recovered
from her fright and hours of imprisonment?
Was not the town ringing with her courage and
quaint sayings? For she had told her story
more than once; and when she came to the
place where she said, &#8220;And I thought, &#8216;God
can see me all the time; if He means for me to
suffer awfully I must have an awful lot of
courage; I must ask Him for it.&#8217; So I did, and
I said &#8216;Now I lay me,&#8217; and lay down on the bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
so I could hear God speak&mdash;you know you
can hear better lying down&mdash;and I waited&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>When she came to this point all her listeners
looked for their handkerchiefs. And May Nell
stopped suddenly, smiled, and finished, &#8220;And
God heard me; and Billy rescued me.&#8221;</p>

<p>May Nell was not taken to her father; he
came to her. Edith&#8217;s pictures of the little girl
fulfilled their mission; they met him as soon
as he landed from South America. He had
been a busy man during those few days; had
found not only his child but his wife, ill in a
country sanitarium; where, for weeks after
the earthquake and fire had, she supposed,
swallowed her little daughter, she lingered,
praying only to die. Now with husband and
child both saved to her, she was fast growing
well; needed only their presence to complete
her recovery.</p>

<p>It was on the first of these busy days in San
Francisco that the big counterfeiter saw at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
distance May Nell&#8217;s father; saw the child&#8217;s
pictures posted in the galleries, hurried back to
the &#8220;Ha&#8217;nt,&#8221; and planned the kidnapping as a
chance for &#8220;getting even&#8221; with Mr. Smith, who
had discharged him years before for dishonesty.
But Billy had thwarted him, brought him safely
to justice for all of his crimes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always knew that house had something to
do with me,&#8221; Billy declared to Mr. Smith.
&#8220;The kids call it a wicked house, but it&#8217;s only
the people living in it that&#8217;s wicked. It&#8217;s
a splendid old place; and when I&#8217;m a man and
have money enough, I&#8217;m going to buy it and
fix it up fine, and give it a fair chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Friday came; and May Nell delighted her
father with her part in the exercises. Billy
was very proud of her as she stood on the platform,
lovely in her white frock and her fair,
curling hair, reciting her &#8220;piece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the swellest looking one in the whole
school,&#8221; he whispered to his smiling mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>&#8220;The prize is equally divided between James
Dorr and William Bennett,&#8221; the judges announced.</p>

<p>And that night after school, when May Nell&#8217;s
little wardrobe was all packed,&mdash;not without
a slight baptism of Edith&#8217;s tears,&mdash;and waiting
for the morning train, Mr. Smith came in and
put a ceremonious looking document into
Billy&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Sheriff tells me a thousand dollars will
be paid to your account as soon as the State
settles, Billy. Here&#8217;s something else for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy turned the bulky papers over and over
as if to gather some hint of their meaning from
fold and stiffness. &#8220;What is it, Mr. Smith?&#8221;
he asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A deed to the stone house, the Ha&#8217;nt, May
Nell calls it. I was glad to know of something
you wanted; and I&#8217;ll furnish the money to
redeem the place to your idea of the beauty it
deserves. It is a splendid location. And Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Bennett,&#8221; he turned to Billy&#8217;s mother, &#8220;you
must let me see Billy through college.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! It&#8217;s too much. We only did
what all&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too much?&#8221; he interrupted; &#8220;is anything
I have in this world too much to give for the life
of my wife and child? Didn&#8217;t your son save
them both? Save May Nell from&mdash;&#8221; He
turned away and did not attempt to finish his
sentence.</p>

<p>May Nell ran and hugged Mrs. Bennett, and
Edith and Billy in turn, nestling afterward in
her father&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely Billy has earned it, Mrs. Bennett,&#8221;
Mr. Smith urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m always going to be your little
girl, too,&#8221; the child pleaded; &#8220;so Billy must
be my papa&#8217;s little boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett looked fondly at Billy, then
back to Mr. Smith. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said
slowly, trying to gather courage for what she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
was to say. &#8220;Billy must not be paid for doing
his duty. With the money he has earned from
the State I am sure we shall be able to help
him through a good schooling; for the rest my
husband&#8217;s son must win his own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy felt his head lift a little higher at his
mother&#8217;s words; felt a new standard of honor
and independence leap into being. The house
was too small for him. He ran out into the
summer evening, down the hill to the big rock
that overhangs Runa Creek. The stars were beginning
to shine, and he could hear the tinkle
of the water below. Bouncer rubbed against
him, and Billy hugged him to the peril of the
old dog&#8217;s breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;They shan&#8217;t ever again call me Billy To-morrow.
It&#8217;s Billy To-day, Bouncer. It shall
always be <i>Billy To-day</i>!&#8221;</p>
